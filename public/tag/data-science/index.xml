      <title>Does a r/WallStreetBets Portfolio Significantly Outperform?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/wallstreet-bets-stock-analysis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the prevalence of COVID-19 in our everyday lives, it&amp;rsquo;s getting increasingly difficult to return to normal for most people. While I&amp;rsquo;ve used this additional flexibility to pick up on old hobbies (gaming, music, etc.), others have used theirs to learn about financial markets. Knowing that I work in finance, some of my friends have reached out to me for financial pointers, while others have opted for the convenience of reading r/WallStreetBets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be asking, why am I &amp;ndash; someone who would be considered a &amp;ldquo;sophiscated investor&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; would even be interested in a platform such as r/WallStreetBets? For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, I&amp;rsquo;ve written a piece about the subreddit last year. However, it was never clearly explained the buzz around r/WallStreetBets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the pandemic (the financial insecurity and flexibility it brought to millions of people), as well as the stimulus checks provided by the government and the rise of free trading platforms such as Robinhood, a lot of people who would typically not dabble with stocks are having fun with the stock market. They&amp;rsquo;re also investing in all sorts of zany things like Dogecoin and GameStop. Institutional Investors (the &amp;ldquo;smart money&amp;rdquo;) and the veterans in the financial media fail to understand this, and they&amp;rsquo;re generally condescending and negative towards these new brand of retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They call them idiots for taking risks in cryptocurrencies; they call them fools for believing companies in dying industries with falling revenues are great investments [&lt;a href=&#34;#2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. From this, the term &amp;ldquo;Dumb Money&amp;rdquo; was used to describe this new breed of investors; &amp;ldquo;DOGE/GME to the moon,&amp;rdquo; they frequently chant, much to the disdain and confusion of legacy investors and their friends in the legacy media [&lt;a href=&#34;#3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the condescension, these retail investors decide to take their agency back using the self-described label known as &lt;strong&gt;Retards&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Retards&lt;/strong&gt;, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, is a rearrangement of the word &lt;strong&gt;tradeRS&lt;/strong&gt;. Since they&amp;rsquo;re not considered legitimate &lt;strong&gt;tradeRS&lt;/strong&gt; in the eyes of the investment community, they&amp;rsquo;ll just call themselves &lt;strong&gt;Retards&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an anagram designed to reclaim the agency taken from retail investments. Sure, they may be considered &amp;ldquo;Dumb Money,&amp;rdquo; but they&amp;rsquo;re going to make the investment decisions they want to without the influence and manipulation of institutional investors and their friends in the financial media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is largely the energy behind drama involving r/WallStreetBets and the rest of the investment community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-rwallstreetbets-stock-picks-even-any-good&#34;&gt;Are r/WallStreetBets Stock Picks Even Any Good?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally assumed &amp;ndash; rightly or wrongly &amp;ndash; that if you have a background in finance, you know what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about. The barriers required to work within the industry seem to justify the claim. The most well-known front-end finance jobs require a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree at an accredited four-year university, along with passing, at minimum, the Securities Industry Essentials Exam (or SIE) and either a FINRA Series 3 or 7 Exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs that are more analytically driven, such as Actuaries, may require candidates to have a statistical or mathematical background and pass several SOA (Society of Actuaries) Exams. While Quants (which is my domain) typically don&amp;rsquo;t require examinations; however, some positions do encourage and require candidates to have at minimum a Masters of Science in a STEM field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, it may be easy to see why people on Wall Street are considered &amp;ldquo;Smart Money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you need education and fancy certificates to make good investments.  Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors alive, began to invest on his own when he was only 11-years-old. While the man would never even look at any of the companies r/WallStreetBets are investing in, he established a system that allowed him to make sound investments using the resources available at the time; namely, a book published by Benjamin Graham called The Intelligent Investor. Speaking from personal experience, I started learning about finance and economics on my own time before I enrolled in university to pursue it as a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the resources available to help retail investors are potentially endless. Most of what you&amp;rsquo;ll find on the internet is bunk; however, you can find invaluable information if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to see if the &lt;strong&gt;TradeRS&lt;/strong&gt; at r/WallStreetBets know where to look. Are they seeing things we aren&amp;rsquo;t seeing or just larping as wall street speculators?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-meme-stocks&#34;&gt;What Are &amp;ldquo;Meme Stocks&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meme stock is a stock that has seen an increase in volume not because of how well the company performs, but rather because of hype on social media and online forums. For this reason, these stocks often become overvalued, seeing drastic price increases in just a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these stocks have not performed well in recent years. Some of these stocks may exist in struggling retail or brick-&amp;amp;-mortor (GME) industries. Other stocks may have once been considered leaders in their respective industries but have rebranded and shifted their focus to maintain viability (BBY). However, one common thing among these meme stocks is that they all follow the same life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Meme-Stocks-Portfolio/meme-stock-life-cycle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the moon&amp;rdquo; was a popular rallying cry for many holders of these stocks. It was used as a reminding, regardless of how much the price may drop, buy and never sell, because we (retail investors) control the value of the stock, and not institutional investors. There is no doube that it can be exciting to make money day trading and to be part of something bigger than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is still a large body of research that suggest that even the most experienced of day traders lose money [&lt;a href=&#34;#4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-meme-stock-portfolio&#34;&gt;Building a &amp;ldquo;Meme Stock&amp;rdquo; Portfolio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/WSB-Favorite-Stocks/02.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Result&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will construct a portfolio using popular stocks from the WallStreetBets community. In July 2021, I decided to find the most talk-about stocks in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit and narrowed the list down to 20 of the most popular equities on the platform. Six of these assets have recently gone public, and they will be excluded from the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re also going to include popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seeking-alpha&#34;&gt;Seeking Alpha&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha, or Jensen&amp;rsquo;s Alpha, quantifies the excess returns obtained by a portfolio of investments above the returns implied by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula is denoted as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$r_{\alpha} = r_{f} + \beta_{\alpha} * (r_{m}-r_{f})+\epsilon$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$r_{f}$ = Risk Free Rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\beta$ = Beta of a security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$r_{m}$ = Expected market return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\epsilon$ = Tracking error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formula can be better understood if we refactor the formula as seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$(r_{\alpha}-r_{f})=\beta_{\alpha}*(r_{m}-r_{f})+\epsilon$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left side of the equation gives us the difference between the asset return and risk-free rate, the &amp;ldquo;excess return.&amp;rdquo; If we regress the market excess return against the asset excess return, the slope represents the asset&amp;rsquo;s beta. Therefore, beta can also be calculated by the equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\beta=\frac{Cov(r_{a},r_{b})}{var(r_{b})}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So beta can be described as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\beta=\rho_{a,b}*\frac{\sigma_{a}}{\sigma_{b}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula above shows that beta can be explained by the correlated relative volatility. To make this simplier, beta can be calculated by doing a simple linear regression which can be viewed as a factor to explain the return, and the tracking error can represent alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of alpha &amp;ndash; the excess returns &amp;ndash; can vary. A positive number signal&amp;rsquo;s overperformance relative to the benchmark, while a negative number signals underperformance. Zero (or a number close to zero) shows a neutral performance; the fund tracks the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAPM formula utilizes the risk-free rate to account for risk. Therefore, if a given security is fairly priced, the expected returns should be the same as the returns estimated by CAPM. However, if the security were to earn morethan the risk-adjusted returns, the alpha should be positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;descriptive-statistics-risk--return&#34;&gt;Descriptive Statistics (Risk &amp;amp; Return)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does our meme stock portfolio perform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Meme-Stocks-Portfolio/alpha.png&#34; alt=&#34;alpha&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, most of the stocks in our portfolio outperform the S&amp;amp;P 500 by a modest margin. Out of the 20 assets, 8 of them outperform our benchmark at least 1%, and 3 have underperformed our benchmark. If we average the , it comes out to 0.9386, which means that our meme stock portfolio only outperforms the S&amp;amp;P by 0.93% (I got this figure by simply averaging the  for each asset). So, should you invest in a portfolio like this? I suppose it &amp;ldquo;depends&amp;rdquo; on your income goals and overall suitability (after all, this isn&amp;rsquo;t investment advice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m a college student, probably majoring in economics/finance with an interest in quant finance, and I&amp;rsquo;m just experimenting with investment strategies, I might be grateful that my strategy is at least slightly better than the S&amp;amp;P. However, if I&amp;rsquo;m a grown adult looking generate wealth, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would be satisfied with 0.93%, which barely accounts for management fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, those who consider meme stocks a sound investment are usually self-taught and were first introduced to investing during the AMC/GME/DOGE craze. Needless to say, they are probably managing their own portfolios (no management fees for them). It may be difficult to quantitatively comprehend the idea of an  0.93, especially when so many assets can perform much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Meme-Stocks-Portfolio/beta.png&#34; alt=&#34;beta&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, most assets (especially stocks) are positively correlated with the broader market. Most of the assets in our portfolio have $\beta$ greater than 1, which means they are more volatile than the overall market. As we see, CLF has a $\beta$ of 1.7, which means we can expect this stock to increase by 1.7% for every 1% increase in the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;portfolio-optimization&#34;&gt;Portfolio Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown that our meme stock portfolio outperforms the S&amp;amp;P 500 by 0.93%, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it will typically outperform our benchmark by this amount. This amount can change, based on the size of our portfolio, as well as how we weigh each asset. We can figure out how to best do this, by utilizing the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The MPT is a method for selecting investments in order to maximize their overall returns within an acceptable level of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we are trying to find the most efficient portfolio possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we measure the efficiency? We measure it with another formula known as the Sharp Ratio. The Sharpe ratio measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. The sharpe ratio can be calculated by the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$Sharpe Ratio = \frac{R_{p}-R_{f}}{\sigma_{p}} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater the Sharpe ratio, the better, as it indicates that an instrument&amp;rsquo;s returns are large relative to its risk. Also, the greater the Sharpe ratio, the higher the earnings on average than the risk-free rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Meme-Stocks-Portfolio/portfolio.png&#34; alt=&#34;beta&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;ve allocated all 20 of our assets based on our risk tolerance. As you can see, our program has plotted 100,000 unique portfolios, with annualized returns ($\alpha$) on our y-axis and annualized volatility ($\beta$) on our x-axis. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to select a random portfolio inside the curve, but there will always be some portfolio out there, with the same number of assets, that will outperform in terms of returns and risk. The optimal or efficient portfolio will always exist somewhere on the edge of the curve, hence, the efficient frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want the least about of risk possible, using our selected 20 instruments, we should allocate most of our funds towards BBBY, RNG, TWNK, TX, USA, X, HCA, VRTX, and BTC. These 9 instruments will comprise 77.4% of the portfolio. By allocating the portfolio in this way and prioritizing risk, we will achieve an excess annualized return (our $\alpha$) and volatility of 0.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we only care about maximizing return? If we want the greatest return possible, using the same 20 instruments, we should allocate most of our funds towards AMC, CLF, GME, BB, TWNK, SAVA, HCA, BTC, and DOGE. These assets will comprise ~75% of our portfolio. Using this optimal portfolio allocation which prioritizes returns, our portfolio achieves an annualized return of 0.84, with a volatility of 0.51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So compared to the descriptive statistical analysis we&amp;rsquo;ve used earlier, we&amp;rsquo;ve actually &lt;strong&gt;OVERSTATED&lt;/strong&gt; our return for this portfolio. Using the most optimal allocation method possible, with thousands of different possibilities, we find that our meme stock portfolio still barely &lt;em&gt;outperformes&lt;/em&gt; our benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, it would be difficult for a serious investor to justify building a portfolio with these 20 assets when there are so many different investments out there that could do significantly better for the least amount of risk. This is especially true if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to avoid investing in assets that appear to be overvalued, such as Bitcoin and GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-from-the-meme-stock-craze&#34;&gt;Lessons From The Meme-Stock Craze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt this analysis will convince anyone apart of r/WallStreetBets, TradeRS, or anyone sympathetic to the meme-stock trading &amp;ldquo;revolution.&amp;rdquo; Much has been written about the heroic campaign by individual investors to slay giant institutional investors. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why this narrative is compelling, so I doubt anyone would want to listen to someone with institutional experiences, such as myself. Regardless, there are still valuable lessons that can be learned from the meme-stock craze, and the effort to democratize financial markets misses the market on many of these lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it&amp;rsquo;s dangerous for investors to follow crowds in stock markets or any need. r/WallStreetBets initiated campaigns to inflate asset prices past their intrinsic value or their long-term fundaments, making opportunities such as GameStop, AMC, and Bed, Bath &amp;amp; Beyond appear to be attractive investment opportunities. But those who bought these stocks close to their peaks are already nursing losses as the shares have come down. Overpaying for stock prices that don&amp;rsquo;t reflect business fundamentals isn&amp;rsquo;t courageous. Many who bought into the hype are already learning this painful lesson on the risk of market fads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Federal Reserve has played an unwitting role creating an enviroment where the meme-stock challenge can happen. In the Fed&amp;rsquo;s efforts to stabilize the economy, money has become virtually free. Ultralow interest rates encourages people to borrow and to take bigger risk to seek better returns. As a result, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen record sums of money being pumped into SPACS (special purpose  acquisition corporations) and private equity funds. As more money chases more opportunity, there are more instances of companies coming to market without being fully-vetted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the cheap money also fuels record retail trading activity. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen this movie before, and it rarely ends well; for those of us who remember the dot-com frenzy in the late 1990s and the mortgage bubble that led to the 2008 financial crisis. With the Fed increasing interest rates to combat persistently high inflation, they will have to reluctantly deflate any bubbles that have emerged. We&amp;rsquo;re venturing onto uncharted territory, where our rookie investors now have to learn to generate alpha in an environment without cheap money and a zero-lower bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, quality is the best recipe for returns. Focusing on high-quality companies is a good defence against irrational market moves. And companies that enjoy strong organic growth drivers aren&amp;rsquo;t beholden to the hypercompetitive M&amp;amp;A market for growth. Building an equity portfolio based on businesses with sustainable earnings growth is a recipe for consistent outperformance and reduced volatility, even in a world where smaller investors can mount powerful campaigns to shock market leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing News Articles With Python</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/analyzing-news-articles-python/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/project/analyzing-news-articles-python/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never before has America become more polarized than we are today. As such, the news we consume is a function of our polarization. Right-leaning people tend to get their information from Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, National Review, etc. People who lean left tend to get their information from MSNBC, The New York Times, The Huffington Post, etc. There are a handful of neutral publications (Reuters, Politico, Associated Press, etc.). Still, even their alignment falls into question, based on how they report the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/partisan.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Partisan Divide&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unclear to what extent news plays a role in fueling the partisan divide in our country. There is some evidence to suggest that people, when given accurate information on controversial issues, will choose to disregard this information to fit commonly held beliefs [&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. This perhaps can explain the apparent bias for news outlets. Now, more than ever, people should be allowed to sift through news sources that are free from bias, misinformation, and personal polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-sides-news-aggregator&#34;&gt;All Sides News Aggregator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an old Pew Research poll, most Americans would prefer if news media would present the facts without adding their interpretation of the events [&lt;a href=&#34;#2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. Some may argue that objectivity in the news has never occurred, and therefore, impossible, and in some cases, undesirable. Regardless of whether or not our news should be presented from an objective lens, at the very least, journalists should be honest about their affiliation. In comes &lt;strong&gt;All Sides&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Sides is a bipartisan organization that looks at a more balanced approach to news coverage by collecting the top headlines of the day and showcasing the reporting of the news outlet on the left, right, and center. The platform also allows readers the rate the lean of the publication for further analysis [&lt;a href=&#34;#3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mode of attack is figuring out how we can go about extracting these stories for our analysis. We can extract all stories from all publications, but what if we want a more targeted focus? One interesting feature of the All Sides website is that we can look for articles based on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/topics-allsides.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;All Sides&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get articles from pretty much any topic: Criminal Justice, Education, and the Economy. All Sides even collects the news perspectives on the most important topic in the world right now, the Coronavirus. (Yes, our society is so divided right now, we&amp;rsquo;ve even managed to politize a deadly virus)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to use immigration as our topic; I feel it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to understand where both sides (the political left and right) stand on this issue. The first part of the project involves web scraping the information that we are most interested in, such as the headline, date of the story, description, source, the lean/bias of the source, and the link of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/example_articles.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;example articles&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results provide a data frame that we can use as a stepping stone to extract relevant information, such as the body of the article and the authors. Sure, we could have extracted all of that information along with the rest. However, web scraping is very tricky, as no two websites have the same HTML structure and layout. This is especially true for news media websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, we relied on a third-party source for the extracting news, with the API known as &lt;strong&gt;News-Please&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;news-please-api&#34;&gt;News Please API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News-Please is an open source news crawler that extracts structured information from almost any website. You can use it to follow recursively internal hyperlinks and read RSS feeds to extract most recent and old archived articles [&lt;a href=&#34;#4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this API, we only need to provide the root URL of the article to crawl it completely. The New-Please API combines the power of multiple state-of-the-art libraries and tools, such as &lt;code&gt;scrapy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Newspaper&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;readability&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this API, along with other web crawler techniques, we have randomly extracted 291 articles from multiple sources. The Top 10 articles we extracted are presented in the following data frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/example_articles2.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;example article #2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, Fox News has the largest number of articles in our dataset, with 25 pieces. Reuters is right behind Fox News with 20 articles, followed by the Wall Street Journal (News Section), Washington Times, and The Hill with 20, 17, and 15 articles, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only speak for myself, but from what I see so far, I believe this alignment is correct for the most part. Fox News tends to lean right, while CNN and New York Times lean more left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think some people would disagree with the alignment of the Wall Street Journal, as the publisher is owned by News Corp, which is the parent company of Fox News. I believe most people would be inclined to agree, as far as community feedback on All Sides is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/topics-allsides5.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;All Sides&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, whether or not a news outlet is owned or operated by a particular person has little to do with its overall objectivity and bias. All Sides has conducted an in-depth analysis of major news publications such as The Wall Street Journal and has found that outlet is more aligned to the center than its peers. (Keep in mind, a Center alignment doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean better!) [&lt;a href=&#34;#5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/example_articles3.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;example article 3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everything is extracted, we should get the data frame similar to what we presented above. The author and text columns are highlighted to demonstrate that we have obtained this new information. We&amp;rsquo;ve also included the length of characters for each article (for reasons that will be clear later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have all of the information that we need, we can now conduct what is known as a &lt;strong&gt;Sentiment Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sentiment-analysis&#34;&gt;Sentiment Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally (at least, programming languages)  determining whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. It&amp;rsquo;s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all received text messages or e-mails, where we are not sure the emotion the sender is trying to convey. Certain words may carry a specific connotation that is not clear to many different types of people. Sentiment Analysis can be considered an unbias way of analyzing text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning practitioners utilize sentiment analysis in several different fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politics&lt;/strong&gt;: I suppose this project involves politics to some degree, but we can use sentiment analysis to keep track of the consistency between specific statements and actions at the government level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance&lt;/strong&gt;: As you are already aware, I am in the Finance industry. My personal experience using Sentiment Analysis in Finance consists of analyzing news articles related to specific publicly traded companies and predicting stock movements based on how the news impacted the underlying stock. This is just one example, but there are dozens of different examples of how sentiment analysis is used in Finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shopping (Online, Restaurants)&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you ever tried to purchase a product on Amazon? (You&amp;rsquo;re human; of course, you have.) How do you know if you can trust the reviews? What about the reviews on a Yelp listing? Sentiment Analysis can help you determine whether or not a review is fake or made by a real person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we are using it to examine the bias of news articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;natural-language-processing-using-google-api&#34;&gt;Natural Language Processing using Google API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. Python already provides a well-known NLP module for this task, namely the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). However, there is a lot that goes into preparing the data to feed through a Naive Bayes or Support Vector Classifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/topics-allsides7.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Natural Language&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the process for using the &lt;code&gt;nltk&lt;/code&gt; module is a painstaking process, as you can see. If we compare it with Google&amp;rsquo;s Natural Language API, the process looks a little more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/topics-allsides8.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Google API&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, it&amp;rsquo;s much more manageable. No need to look for specific stop words, tokenize the text, or test/train our dataset to fit the module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use Google Natural Language API, you need to set up a Cloud Library account, enable the Natural Language API, and download the project file you are using for the API. The tutorial for this process can be  [&lt;a href=&#34;#6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next process involves using Google&amp;rsquo;s NLP API to analyze the articles we&amp;rsquo;ve extracted from Part Two. We are going to create a loop that measures the Sentiment and Magnitude of each text and assign it to two new columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sentiment-and-magnitude&#34;&gt;Sentiment and Magnitude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the concept behind &lt;strong&gt;Sentiment&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Magnitude&lt;/strong&gt;, and how does it help us in our analysis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sentiment&lt;/strong&gt; attempts to determine the overall attitude (positive or negative) expressed within the text. The of a text will range between -1.0 (negative) and 1.0 (positive). Of course, it goes without saying that a score of 0.0 is considered neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnitude&lt;/strong&gt; indicates the overall strength of the emotion (either positive or negative) within the given text. We&amp;rsquo;re not sure how high this metric can go; however, the minimum us always 0. Unlike sentiment, magnitude is not normalized; each expression of emotion within the text (positive and negative) contributes to the text magnitude. So longer text may have greater magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/example_articles4.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;example article 4&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the Natural Language indicates differences between positive and negative emotion in a document, but does not identify specific positive and negative emotions. For example, &amp;ldquo;angry&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sad&amp;rdquo; are both considered negative emotions. However, when the Natural Language analyzes text that is considered &amp;ldquo;angry,&amp;rdquo; or text that is considered &amp;ldquo;sad,&amp;rdquo; the response only indicates that the sentiment in the text is negative, not &amp;ldquo;sad&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;angry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, our DataFrame has returned the results of our Sentiment Analysis for the articles published from April 14th - 14th. As we can see, the majority of the articles are negative. It unclear whether or not this is any relation to the subject matter or just the nature of the industry, in general [&lt;a href=&#34;#7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The articles with a sentiment score closer to zero are published by &lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. Looking at the magnitude scores, we can see the &lt;em&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/em&gt; article has a magnitude of 36; however, we have to remember that the value is proportional to the length of the text. Seeing that the article published by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/em&gt; has 17,000+ characters, this makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/em&gt; is not part of the mainstream media and primarily publishes opinion and commentary, which explains the degree in magnitude. If anything, the articles published by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; can be considered mixed (a neutral sentiment with a strong degree of emotion)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The articles published by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; shows a sentiment score of -0.5 and a magnitude of 3.3 and 3.4, respectively, which shows a clear negative sentiment. (Most people would not find this surprising coming from NYT) However, &lt;em&gt;Fox News (Online)&lt;/em&gt; has two similar stories that convey a slightly less negative sentiment. Because the sentiment is less than -0.5 and the magnitude is relatively strong, we would rate the sentiment for both &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; articles mixed, rather than clearly positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Clearly Positive&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;clearly&amp;rdquo; negative sentiment varies for different cases and outlets; however, because the vast majority of news articles are negative (or at the very least, has a sentiment score of less than 0), we require a meaningful threshold to determine if an article was truly negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is all dependent upon the dataset, as well as the types of articles we extract. However (for now), we choose to use this threshold for news involving political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visualizations-and-statistical-analysis&#34;&gt;Visualizations and Statistical Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-and-whiskers-plot&#34;&gt;Box and Whiskers Plot&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, this information is a little harder to convey on a histogram. It can be seen more clearly on a box and whiskers plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution (as well as the skew) are more apparent when presented in the form of a box and whiskers plot. I&amp;rsquo;ve also presented the data to show where the outliers are. In order to determine which observations in distribution would be considered an outlier, we need to find something that is called the &lt;strong&gt;Interquartile Range&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;interquartile range&lt;/strong&gt; or (IQR) measures where the median of the dataset should be. While the range is the measure of the highest and lowest values (visible where the &amp;ldquo;whiskers&amp;rdquo; are found), the interquartile range is the range where the bulk of the values lie. It&amp;rsquo;s usually preferred as a measurement of spread when reporting values such as SAT scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IQR can be found by finding the difference between Q3 and Q1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$IQR=Q3-Q1$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/topics-allsides9.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;example boxwhisker&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have found the IQR for each dataset, we now need to calculate the lower and upper bounds. The lower bounds can be found by taking Q1 and subtracting by 1.5 times the IQR. The upper bound can be found using the same way, except we are using addition instead of subtraction. To bring this explanation in perspective, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use a few statistics for right-leaning sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each diamond plotted above the whisker is considered an outlier,  and they&amp;rsquo;re lots of them in our right-leaning dataset. However, these articles primarily consist of opinion pieces from the &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Christian Perspective&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;National Post&lt;/em&gt;. (The largest magnitude in our dataset for right-leaning sources)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the outliers, the distribution of the right-leaning dataset is still similar to that of the &amp;ldquo;politically-neutral&amp;rdquo; sources. However, there is a major skew in the distribution for left-leaning sources. Although the variation is greater (IQR of 17.6!), the whisker on the far end is much longer than the whisker for right/center-leaning sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Analyzing-News/box-and-whisker.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;example boxwhisker&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data suggests that writers for left-leaning outlets are more likely to implement their personal feelings and emotions into the articles they publish. I suppose we can expect this from outlets such as &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; and perhaps &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, but the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times are considered more &amp;ldquo;news-oriented&amp;rdquo; outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I made a mistake when scraping news and didn&amp;rsquo;t realize I was collecting pieces from the editorial section. OR maybe the mistake was made on their part when mislabeling an article &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; when it should have been labeled &amp;ldquo;opinion.&amp;rdquo; Who can say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more that can be done here; we&amp;rsquo;re just scratching the surface. Using data science and machine learning in the news/political field means that we can conduct a range of meaningful analysis. We can expand this work into other research, such as News Classification, Filtering Bubbles/Echo Analysis, Topic Modeling, Entity Analysis (probably the next project), news bias prediction, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of hyper-partisan tensions, this tribal news-cycle can only get worse. We need more people who are willing to analyze the direction our media is taking so viewers can make informed decisions about how to consume their news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I have more free time (currently working from home), I guess that person might as well be me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracking COVID-19 Cases Globally</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/tracking-covid19-cases/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/project/tracking-covid19-cases/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of an illness called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the disease that causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019). The disease is considered the most infectious and deadly illness since the Spanish Flu in 1919. In response, schools have closed; Public areas have shut down because; economies have come to a grinding halt because of it, and we&amp;rsquo;re all paranoid about being around other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us have never lived through a Pandemic (unless you count the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic), so we will have no idea how bad this could possible get. Scientist have attempted to determine how deadly this dieases is compared to others throughout history, as seen in the following chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, it&amp;rsquo;s assumed that this virus is just as contagious as other diseases such Polio and the Common Cold while being more deadly than these other diseases. As such, the scientific community has devoted all of their resources in finding ways to track the growth of this dieases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this notebook is to determine the rate at which confirmed cases of COVID-19 are growing in many places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/comparison.png&#34; alt=&#34;Infectious Disease Comparison&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, it&amp;rsquo;s assumed that this virus is just as contagious as other diseases such Polio and the Common Cold while being more deadly than these other diseases. As such, the scientific community has devoted all of their resources in finding ways to track the growth of this dieases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this notebook is to determine the rate at which confirmed cases of COVID-19 are growing in many places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data I will be using for this project comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;John Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;, which has developed a COVID-19 map, which tracks the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalization, and deaths around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hopkins also provides a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Repository&lt;/a&gt; of global COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-basic-ideas&#34;&gt;Some Basic Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of mathematical techniques known as compartmental models that are used to model infectious diseases. In these models, epidemiologist divides the population into separate groups, with the assumption that individuals in the same compartments share the same characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in the early stages of COVID-19, and we are still learning more about the virus every day. To accurately forecast the growth of COVID-19, the underlying dynamics of transmission need to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving factors COVID-19 (as well as any other dieases) includes the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of people on average becomes infected. This is known as the &amp;ldquo;reproduction rate,&amp;rdquo; or $R_{0}$. Basically, if one person becomes infected, how many people will this person infect on average by coming into contact with other people? The World Health Organization is has estimated that this rate is around 1.4 - 2.5 people in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of time it takes for the virus to double is measured by the growth cumulative confirmed cases, which is different from the frowth of infections. The doubling as time passes is a trend known as Exponential Growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The doubling time calculated here measures the growth of cumulative confirmed cases, which is different from the growth of infections. For example, if a country suddenly ramps up testing, then the number of confirmed cases will rapidly rise. Still, infections may not be growing at the same rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/SIRanimationlow.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Contagion Simulation&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following graph shows how an epidemic might spread across a network over time. Blue dots are susceptible individuals, while red dots are infected people. Two dots are connected by a line if they are in contact with each other, and the more connections a person has, the bigger their dot is on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exponential growth models start with a small number of infected individuals in a large population, such as when the virus first emerged in Wuhan, China. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not a good model once a large number of people have been infected. This is because the chance of an infected person contacting a susceptible person declines, simply because there are fewer susceptible people around, and a growing fraction of people have recovered and developed some level of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the chances of an infected person contacting a susceptible person becomes low enough that the rate of infection decreases, leading to fewer cases and eventually, the end of the viral spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-at-the-data&#34;&gt;Looking at the Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we&amp;rsquo;re going to aggregate the daily Coronavirus cases by each country, rather than the Province or State. We&amp;rsquo;re going to sort these values in ascending order and filter our nations with more than 1,000 cases thus far. This gives us roughly 70 countries to work with.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/cases_df.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Cases by country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the U.S. has the highest number of COVID causes in the world. The nation crossed that milestone &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52239261&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sometime last week&lt;/a&gt;. Right behind the U.S. is Spain, Italy, Germany, and France. As mentioned previously, as nations conduct more testing, we can confirm more cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we will be fitting the graph on a Logistic Curve, which is commonly used to represent growth processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$f(x)=\frac{a_{0}-a_{1}}{1+(x/a_{2})^{a_{3}}}+a_{1}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logistic curve has determined by the 4 parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial Value: The value of the curve as $x$ goes to zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Value: The value of the curve as $x$ foes to infinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Center: The halfway point in the transition from Initial Value to Final Value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hill Slope: The Hill slope of the curve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also create a python function for the exponential function. Both will be utilizes for determining the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;logistic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;exponential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we&amp;rsquo;re going to create a function that allows us to plot historical case for each country, which will vary throughout time. This will involve create a time series array for each individual country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each country, we record the most recent cases from this week, as well as the number of cases from the same time period one week ago. We will use this information to calculate a ratio, which will serve as the one-day growth rate, weekly growth rate, and the growth factor for the exponential function. The growth factor is what&amp;rsquo;s used to measure the amount of time it takes cases to double (which is currently every 3 days for most of the Western world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code will attempt to create an exponential curve fit and a logistic curve fit, based on the trend the nation is experiencing. We estimate the fit by simply calculating the the sum of total residuals relative to the total sum of squares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$R^{2}=1-\frac{SS_{RES}}{SS_{TOT}}=1-\frac{\sum_{1}(y_{i}-\hat{y}&lt;em&gt;{i})^{2}}{\sum&lt;/em&gt;{1}(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{i})^{2}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the code has modeled both functions, it will determine if a logistic or exponential curve fits better (the program may also use both if it is unable to determine which curve fits better). Based on that calculation, the program will return the Weekly increase, Daily increase, and the doubling time, as well as the $R^{2}$ and the amount of time it takes for cases to double. After these calculations are done, the code will return a plot for each country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/us_growth_trends.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Cases by country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;ve plotted the trends for all nations with more than 1,000 cases as of April 12th. The U.S. still appears to be on an exponential trend, while Italy and Spain seem to be coming out of it. This should make sense, seeing as Italy&amp;rsquo;s and Spain&amp;rsquo;s lockdowns were more aggressive than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/spain_italy_growth_trends.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Cases by country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two European nations have also started their lockdowns early, with Italy and Spain beginning their lockdowns on March 9th and 14th, respectively. Lockdowns within the U.S. vary by state; however, the most highly impacted states (California and New York) didn&amp;rsquo;t institute any lockdowns until the last week of March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the recent spike in cases in France, our program couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell if the trend was exponential or logistic. As a result, both trends were plotted. Today, more than 500 people died in France in a single day, which prompted the government to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trtworld.com/life/france-extends-virus-lockdown-as-death-toll-nears-15-000-latest-updates-35348&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;extend the lockdowns until May 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/china_growth_trends.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Cases by country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is also currently experiencing a logistic trend. With the exception for the Guangdong province, the nation has not recorded any new cases in any of its provinces since April 7th. China has not had a consistent and reliable metric of reporting GDP figures. For the same reason, people are more or less skeptical of the integrity of their COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;doubling-times-for-covid-19-cases&#34;&gt;Doubling Times for COVID-19 Cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;re going to plot the inferred doubling times and recent doubling times for all countries in one chart. We&amp;rsquo;ve already calculated this previously. The inferred doubling times are constructed using curve fits. In contrast, the recent doubling times are calculated using the most recent week of data. Obviously, the shorter amount of time it takes for cases to double, the faster overall cases grow, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/doubing_times_global.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;doubling times&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inferred doubling time represents the growth encountered during the middle of the growth of the epidemic, which gives us a picture of the overall rate of growth of the virus. After all, epidemiologist won&amp;rsquo;t really know whether or not we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the apex of the pandemic until many weeks (or possibly months). In one country that reports 1,000 COVID-19 cases, there could be 5,000 infected people. On the other hand, another country with the same reported figures could have 100,000 infected people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, the growth rate in the U.S. is still exponential, and the inferred doubling time is around 7 days. For France, the doubling time is approximately 10 days. Obviously, the high the doubling rate, the more manageable the pandemic is for any particular country. There are very few countries within the error range that we have established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;covid-19-trends-in-the-united-states&#34;&gt;COVID-19 Trends in the United States&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done many comparisons with the U.S. (mostly because I currently live in the U.S.). We can extend the same analysis to areas within the country. This time, we will be using a different dataset, which only incorporates the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/cases_us_df.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Cases by country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, New York has the largest number of confirmed cases in the entire nation; followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, and then Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/tracking-covid-cases/ny_growth_trends.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Cases by country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York&amp;rsquo;s COVID-19 growth appears to be consistent with a logistic trend, but it might be too early to tell. Other states where the growth seems to be more exponential are Illinois, California, and Washington. Most other states appear to be within the starting phase of a logistic trend, but it might be too early to say, based on the average doubling time (which is 5 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, cases double in New York roughly 8 days, while Massachusetts doubles every 5 days. Michigan&amp;rsquo;s stay-at-home order is set to expire tomorrow if the Governor of that state chooses not to extend the lockdown. However, COVID-19 growth appears to be on the logistic trend, and cases are doubling every 11 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still more to learn about this virus. We&amp;rsquo;re still trying to come up with ways to track its behavior, which can only happen with more testing. One thing that can be certain is that this crisis is nowhere near over. As data comes more available, we will be taking steps to analyze it, which will provide more insight into where we need to focus our resources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pairs-trading-strategies-using-python&#34;&gt;Pairs Trading Strategies Using Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making money in the stock market, there are a myriad of different ways to make money. And it seems that in the finance community, everywhere you go, people are telling you that you should learn Python. After all, Python is a popular programming language which can be used in all types of fields, including data science. There are a large number of packages that can help you meet your goals, and many companies use Python for development of data-centric applications and scientific computation, which is associated with the financial world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all Python can help us utilize many different trading strategies that (without it) would by very difficult to analyze by hand or with spreadsheets. One of the trading strategies we will talk about is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;Pairs Trading.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pairs-trading&#34;&gt;Pairs Trading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pairs trading is a form of &lt;em&gt;mean-reversion&lt;/em&gt; that has a distinct advantage of always being hedged against market movements. It is generally a high alpha strategy when backed up by some rigorous statistics. The stratey is based on mathematical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prinicple is as follows. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a pair of securities X and Y that have some underlying economic link. An example might be two companies that manufacture the same product, or two companies in one supply chain. If we can model this economic link with a mathematical model, we can make trades on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand pairs trading, we need to understand three mathematical concepts: &lt;strong&gt;Stationarity, Integration, and Cointegration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This will assume everyone knows the basics of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HypothesisTesting.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hypothesis testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stationarity is the most commonly untested assumption in time series analysis. We generally assume that data is stationary when the parameters of the data generating process do not change over time. Else consider two series: A and B. Series A will generate a stationary time series with fixed parameters, while B will change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will create a function that creates a z-score for probability density function. The probability density for a Gaussian distribution is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\mu$ is the mean and  $\sigma$ the standard deviation. The square of the standard deviation, $\sigma^{2}$, is the variance. The empircal rule dictates that 66% of the data should be somewhere between $x+\sigma$ and $x-\sigma$, which implies that the function &lt;code&gt;numpy.random.normal&lt;/code&gt; is more likely to return samples lying close to the mean, rather than those far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, we can create two plots that exhibit a stationary and non-stationary time series. The left time series will be stationary, whereas the right will be non-stationary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-stationarity-is-important&#34;&gt;Why Stationarity is Important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many statistical tests require that the data being tested are stationary. Using certain statistics on a non-stationary data set may lead to garbage results. As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s take an average through our non-stationary $B$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/average_timeseries_seriesB.png&#34; alt=&#34;Averge time series&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computed mean will show that the mean of all data points, but won&amp;rsquo;t be useful for any forecasting of the future state. It&amp;rsquo;s meaningless when compared with any specific time, as it&amp;rsquo;s a collection of different states at different times mashed together. This is just a simple and clear example of why non-stationarity can distort the analysis, much more subtle problems can arise in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;augmented-dickey-fuller&#34;&gt;Augmented Dickey Fuller&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to test for stationarity, we need to test for something called a &lt;em&gt;unit root&lt;/em&gt;. Autoregressive unit root test is based on the following hypothesis test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{0} &amp;amp; : \phi =\ 1\ \implies y_{t} \sim I(0) \ | \ (unit \ root) \
H_{1} &amp;amp; : |\phi| &amp;lt;\ 1\ \implies y_{t} \sim I(0) \ | \ (stationary)  \
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s referred to as a unit root tet because under the null hypothesis, the autoregressive polynominal of $\mathcal{z}_{t},\ \phi (\mathcal{z})=\ (1-\phi \mathcal{z}) \ = 0$, has a root equal to unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$y_{t}$ is trend stationary under the null hypothesis. If $y_{t}$is then first differenced, it becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta y_{t} &amp;amp; = \delta\ + \Delta\mathcal{z}&lt;em&gt;{t} \
\Delta \mathcal{z} &amp;amp; = \phi\Delta\mathcal{z}&lt;/em&gt;{t-1}\ +\ \varepsilon_{t}\ -\ \varepsilon_{t-1} \
\end{aligned}
.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test statistic is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ t_{\phi=1}=\frac{\hat{\phi}-1}{SE(\hat{\phi})}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\hat{\phi}$ is the least square estimate, and SE($\hat{\phi}$) is the usual standard error estimate. The test is a one-sided left tail test. If {$y_{t}$} is stationary, then it can be shown that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\sqrt{T}(\hat{\phi}-\phi)\xrightarrow[\text{}]{\text{d}}N(0,(1-\phi^{2}))$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\hat{\phi}\overset{\text{A}}{\sim}N\bigg(\phi,\frac{1}{T}(1-\phi^{2}) \bigg)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it follows that $t_{\phi=1}\overset{\text{A}}{\sim}N(0,1).$ However, under the null hypothesis of non-stationarity, the above result gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\hat{\phi}\overset{\text{A}}{\sim} N(0,1)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following function will allow us to check for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cointegration&#34;&gt;Cointegration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlations between financial quantities are notoriously unstable. Nevertheless, correlations are regularly used in almost all multivariate financial problems. An alternative statistical measure to correlation is cointegration. This is probably a more robust measure of linkage between two financial quantities, but as yet there is little derivatives theory based on this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two stocks may be perfectly correlated over short timescales, yet diverge in the long run, with one growing and the other decaying. Conversely, two stocks may follow each other, never being more than a certain distance apart, but with any correlation, positive, negative, or varying. If we are delta hedging, then maybe the short timescale correlation matters, but not if we are holding stocks for a long time in an unhedged portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve constructed an example of two cointegrated series. We&amp;rsquo;ll plot the difference between the two now so we can see how this looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/cointegration_spread.png&#34; alt=&#34;cointegration spread&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;testing-for-cointegration&#34;&gt;Testing for Cointegration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps in the cointegration test procdure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test for a unit root in each component series $y_{t}$ individually, using the univariate unit root tests, says ADF, PP test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the unit root cannot be rejected, then the next step is to test cointegration among the components, i.e., to test whether $\alpha Y_{t}$ is I(0).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we find that the time series as a unit root, then we move on to the cointegration process. There are three main methods for testing for cointegration: Johansen, Engle-Granger, and Phillips-Ouliaris. We will primarily use the Engle-Granger test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the regression model for $y_{t}$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$y_{1t} = \delta D_{t} + \phi_{1t}y_{2t} + \phi_{m-1} y_{mt} + \varepsilon_{t} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$D_{t}$ is the deterministic term. From there, we can test whether $\varepsilon_{t}$ is $I(1)$ or $I(0)$. The hypothesis test is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{0} &amp;amp; :  \varepsilon_{t} \sim I(1) \implies y_{t} \ (no \ cointegration)  \
H_{1} &amp;amp; : \varepsilon_{t} \sim I(0) \implies y_{t} \ (cointegration)  \
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If  the time series is cointegrated, then $y_{t}$ is cointegrated with a &lt;em&gt;normalized cointegration vector&lt;/em&gt; $\alpha = (1, \phi_{1}, \ldots,\phi_{m-1}).$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also use residuals $\varepsilon_{t}$ for unit root test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{0} &amp;amp; :  \lambda = 0 \ (Unit \ Root)  \
H_{1} &amp;amp; : \lambda &amp;lt; 1 \ (Stationary)  \
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis test is for the model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta\varepsilon_{t}=\lambda\varepsilon_{t-1}+\sum^{p-1}&lt;em&gt;{j=1}\varphi\Delta\varepsilon&lt;/em&gt;{t-j}+\alpha_{t}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test statistic for the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$t_{\lambda}=\frac{\hat{\lambda}}{s_{\hat{\lambda}}} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand what it means for these time series to be cointegrated, we can test for it and measure it using python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pvalue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;coint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pvalue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;correlation-vs-cointegration&#34;&gt;Correlation vs. Cointegration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation and cointegration, while theoretically similar, are anything but similar. To demonstrate this, we can look at examples of these time series that are correlated, but not cointegrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple example is two series that just diverge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/diverge.png&#34; alt=&#34;cointegration spread&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we can print the correlation coefficient, $r$, and the cointegration test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Correlation: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;X_diverging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;corr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_diverging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pvalue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;coint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;X_diverging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_diverging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Cointegration test p-value: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pvalue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation: 0.9918846224870514&lt;br&gt;
Cointegration test p-value: 0.915621777573125&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, there is a very strong (nearly perfect) correlation between series X and Y. However, our p-value for the cointegration test yields a result of 0.7092, which means there is no cointegration between time series X and Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of this case is a normally distributed series and a sqaure wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/squared_wave.png&#34; alt=&#34;cointegration spread&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the correlation is incredibly low, the p-value shows that these time series are cointegrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-science-in-trading&#34;&gt;Data Science in Trading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, I’ll first define a function that makes it easy to find cointegrated security pairs using the concepts we’ve already covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;score&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;score_matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;score&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pvalue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mf&#34;&gt;0.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;score_matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pvalue_matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pairs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking through a set of tech companies to see if any of them are cointegrated. We&amp;rsquo;ll start by defining the list of securities we want to look through. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll get the pricing data for each security from the year 2013 - 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, we have formulated an economic hypothesis that there is some sort of link between a subset of securities within the tech sector, and we want to test whether there are any cointegrated pairs. This incurs significantly less multiple comparisons bias than searching through hundreds of securities and slightly more than forming a hypothesis for an individual test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have decided to analyze the following technology stocks: AAPL, ADBE, SYMC, EBAY, MSFT, QCOM, HPQ, JNPR, AMD, and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve also decided to include the S&amp;amp;P 500 in our analysis, just in case there was equity that was cointegrated with the entire market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After extracting the historical prices, we will create a heatmap that will show the p-values of the cointegrated test between each pair of stocks. The heatmap will mask all pairs with a p-value greater than 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/heatmap.png&#34; alt=&#34;cointegration spread&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our algorithm listed two pairs that are cointegrated: AAPL/EBAY, and ABDE/MSFT. We will analyze the ABDE/MSFT equity pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;calculating-the-spread&#34;&gt;Calculating the Spread&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can plot the spread of these time series. To actually calculate the spread, we use a linear regression to get the coefficient for the linear combination to construct between our two securities, as mentioned with the Engle-Granger method before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/spread.png&#34; alt=&#34;cointegration spread&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, we can examine the ration between the time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/ratio.png&#34; alt=&#34;cointegration spread&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not we use the spread approach or the ratio approach, we can see that our first plot pair ADBE/SYMC tends to move around the mean. We now need to standardize this ratio because the absolute ratio might not be the most ideal way of analyzing this trend. For this, we need to use z-scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A z-score is the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean. More importantly, the number of standard deviations above or below the population mean is from the raw score. The z-score is calculated by the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\mathcal{z}&lt;em&gt;{i}=\frac{x&lt;/em&gt;{i}-\bar{x}}{s} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/standard_deviation.png&#34; alt=&#34;cointegration spread&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By setting two other lines placed at the z-score of 1 and -1, we can clearly see that for the most part, any big divergences from the mean eventually converge back. This is precisely what we want for a pairs trading strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trading-signals&#34;&gt;Trading Signals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When conducting any type of trading strategy, it&amp;rsquo;s always important to clearly define and delineate at what point you will actually make a trade. As in, what is the best indicator that I need to buy or sell a particular stock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;setup-rules&#34;&gt;Setup rules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to use the ratio time series that we&amp;rsquo;ve created to see if it tells us whether to buy or sell a particular moment in time. We&amp;rsquo;ll start off by creating a prediction variable $Y$. If the ratio is positive, it will signal a &amp;ldquo;buy,&amp;rdquo; otherwise, it will signal a sell. The prediction model is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$Y_{t} = sign(Ratio_{t+1}-Ratio_{t}) $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s great about pair trading signals is that we don&amp;rsquo;t need to know absolutes about where the prices will go, all we need to know is where it&amp;rsquo;s heading: up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;train-test-split&#34;&gt;Train Test Split&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When training and testing a model, it&amp;rsquo;s common to have splits of 70/30 or 80/20. We only used a time series of 252 points (which is the number of trading days in a year). Before training and splitting the data, we will add more data points in each time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;feature-engineering&#34;&gt;Feature Engineering&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to find out what features are actually important in determining the direction of the ratio moves. Knowing that the ratios always eventually revert back to the mean, maybe the moving averages and metrics related to the mean will be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try using these features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 day Moving Average of Ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 day Moving Average of Ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 day Standard Deviation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;z score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;creating-a-model&#34;&gt;Creating a Model&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation 1. Looking at the plot, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that if the time series moves 1 standard deviation beyond the mean, it tends to revert back towards the mean. Using these models, we can create the following trading signals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy(1) whenever the z-score is below -1, meaning we expect the ratio to increase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell(-1) whenever the z-score is above 1, meaning we expect the ratio to decrease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;training-optimizing&#34;&gt;Training Optimizing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use our model on actual data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Trading_Signals.png&#34; alt=&#34;cointegration spread&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;areas-of-improvement-and-further-steps&#34;&gt;Areas of Improvement and Further Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by no means a perfect strategy and the implementation of our strategy isn&amp;rsquo;t the best. However, there are several things that can be improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-using-more-securities-and-more-varied-time-ranges&#34;&gt;1. Using more securities and more varied time ranges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the pairs trading strategy cointegration test, I only used a handful of stocks. Naturally (and in practice) it would be more useful to use clusters within an industry. I only use the time range of only 5 years, which may not be representative of stock market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-dealing-with-overfitting&#34;&gt;2. Dealing with overfitting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything related to data analysis and training models has much to do with the problem of overfitting. There are many different ways to deal with overfitting like validation, such as Kalman filters, and other statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-adjusting-the-trading-signals&#34;&gt;3. Adjusting the trading signals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trading algorithm fails to account for stock prices that overlap and cross each other. Considering that the code only calls for a buy or sell given its ratio, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take into account which stock is actually higher or lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-more-advanced-methods&#34;&gt;4. More advanced methods&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with algorithmic pairs trading. It&amp;rsquo;s simple because it only deals with moving averages and ratios. If you want to use more complicated statistics, feel free to do so. Other complex examples include subjects such as the Hurst exponent, half-life mean reversion, and Kalman Filters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;401k-optimization-using-modern-portfolio-theory&#34;&gt;401K Optimization Using Modern Portfolio Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve often talked about the benefits of computer programming and using technology in Finance to develop more sophisticated trading strategies. Such strategies usually require a unique understanding of mathematics, data science, and statistics; paired along with a rudimentary knowledge of machine learning and programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these significant learning curves, maybe algorithmic trading isn&amp;rsquo;t the way to go. As such, we&amp;rsquo;re simply going to purchase 100,000 dollars worth of an asset class and not worry about what investment strategy we&amp;rsquo;re going to adopt. We&amp;rsquo;ve got the easy part figured out. The hard part is figuring out how much to purchase of one asset over another. How do you figure this out? Do we need to conduct lots of research? Maybe. Or maybe not. With a little help with technology, the answers may be more simple than we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-portfolio-theory-mpt&#34;&gt;Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Modern Portfolio Theory&lt;/strong&gt; conceptualizes how investors (who are risk-averse) construct portfolios that maximize their expected returns for given levels of risk. This provides us with the insight of how risk and return characteristics of various investments need not be isolated but analyzed of how individual investments affect the performance of a portfolio. The assumptions of MPT, thus, emphasize that investors only assume the additional risk when there is a possibility of higher expected returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pioneer of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) was developed by Financial Economist Harry Markowitz&amp;rsquo;s, with his paper &lt;em&gt;Portfolio Selection&lt;/em&gt; (1952). He eventually won a Nobel Memorial Price in 1990 in Economic Sciences for his contribution to the field. To this day, MPT is taught around the world in practically every finance curriculum. The implications for MPT has laid the groundwork for many of the assumptions investors have when constructing portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumptions of MPT are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors are rational and avoid risk whenever possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors aim for the maxmium returns for their investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All investors share the aim of maximizing their expected returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commissions and taxes on the market are left out of the consideration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All investors have access to the same sources and level of all necessary information about investment decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors have unlimited access to borrow and lend money at the risk-free rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental aspect of this theory is the possibility for investors to construct an &amp;ldquo;efficient set of portfolios,&amp;rdquo; which is also known as an &amp;ldquo;Efficient Frontier.&amp;rdquo; These efficient portfolios offer the maximum expected returns for a given level of risk. An investor&amp;rsquo;s tolerance for risk determines the type of &amp;ldquo;efficient portfolio&amp;rdquo; constructed by the investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor which the lowest tolerance would opt for a portfolio that offers the maximum expected return, given the lowest possible risk, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram below gives an example of the concept of Efficient Frontier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different securities post different expected returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diversification&#34;&gt;Diversification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most essential topics utilized after Markowitz&amp;rsquo;s Modern Portfolio Theory was the concept of diversification. By merely constructing portfolios with different combinations of securities, investors could achieve a maximum expected return, given their risk preferences. This is due to the fact that the returns of a portfolio are greatly affected by the nature of the relationship between assets and their weights in the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor can reduce portfolio risk simply by holding combinations of instruments which are not perfectly positively correlate (correlation coefficient $-1\leq\rho_{ij}&amp;lt;1$). In other words, investors can reduce their exposure to individual asset risk by holding a diversified portfolio of assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversification may allow for the same portfolio expected return with reduced risk. These ideas have been started with Markowitz and then reinforced by other economists and mathematicians such as Andrew Brennan who have expressed ideas in the limitation of variance through portfolio theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all the asset pairs have correlations of 0 &amp;ndash; they are perfectly uncorrelated &amp;ndash; the portfolio&amp;rsquo;s return variance is the sum over all assets of the square of the fraction held in the asset times the asset&amp;rsquo;s return variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-portfolio-theory-with-python&#34;&gt;Modern Portfolio Theory with Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are familiar with what 401(k)s are. They&amp;rsquo;re what are known as defined-contribution plans, which the employee and employer can contributions to an investment account. This is not to be confused with pensions, or a defined-benefit plan, which only the employer is responsible for making contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are employees responsible for contributing to their investment accounts, but they&amp;rsquo;re also responsible for choosing the specific investments within their 401(k). This selection usually includes an assortment of stock and bond mutual funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s consider the following mutual funds: &lt;strong&gt;T. Rowe Price Tax-Efficient Equity Fund (PREFX)&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Janus Henderson Forty Fund Class T (JACTX)&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sextant Growth Fund (SSGFX)&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Commerce Growth Fund (CFGRX)&lt;/strong&gt;. PREFX, JACTX, SSGFX, and CFGRX have acquired a 5-year average annual return of 14.33%, 15.93%, 10.23%, and 14.82% respectively. We want to allocate a modest amount of 10,000 into our contribution account (most likely over a certain period). How would we accomplish this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we allocate 10,000 equally among the four mutual funds? Perhaps it is better to allocate a majority of our initial investment in the fund that has accumulated the highest 5-year average annual return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little help of Python, the Modern Portfolio Theory can help us establish an optimal portfolio for our 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;importing-the-data&#34;&gt;Importing The Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can start by important the necessary packages for this project. &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; allows us to conduct numerical computation on python arrays and dataframes, while &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; allows us to manipulate dataframes easily. Considering that we&amp;rsquo;ll be using dataframes of asset prices, this module will be essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The module &lt;code&gt;fix_yahoo_finance&lt;/code&gt; will allow us to extract the necessary asset price information from the Yahoo Finance API (provided that it still works from the time this is read by the view). &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; is used for visualizations, which we will use for illustrate MPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;seaborn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;whitegrid&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;seed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;777&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also be utilizing two other modules in our project. The &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; module provides classes that allows us to manipulate date objects which will be required in our asset class extraction. &lt;code&gt;relativedelta&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;dateutil&lt;/code&gt; module provides extra functionality, such as timedeltas that are expressed in units larger than a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will work with a 2 year time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re also going to select 5 of the best performing mutual funds as of September 2019. These mutual funds consist of large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, international equities, and fixed income. The following list is aquired through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/best-performing-mutual-funds/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;American Association for Individual Investors&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;Oberweis International Opportunities Fund (OBIOX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fairholme Focused Income Fund (FOCIX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the following funds have YTD and 5-year average annual return above 20% and 10% respectively. We will extract a list of historical prices of these tickers going back 5 years, and merge them into a single dataframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/historical_mutual_funds.png&#34; alt=&#34;Historical Mutual Funds&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the asset prices for various different mutual funds range from 50 dollars to only a few dollars. The volatility is also different among our select mutual fund group; however, this may be difficult to see while its presented in the form of a time series. We can create a code that allows us to visualize the volatility of our time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/mutual_fund_volatility.png&#34; alt=&#34;Mutual Fund Volatility&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see from the plot, the ProFunds Semiconductor UltraSector Fund Investor Class (SMPIX) mutual fund is highly volatile. Other mutual funds, while not as volatile, exhibit periods of strong variability. But why is this important? Later on, we will use our understanding of our volatility to calculate the risk-reward trade-off for our select mutual fund portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-and-expected-return&#34;&gt;Risk and Expected Return&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPT assumes that investors are risk-averse, meaning that given two portfolios that offer the same expected return, investors will prefer the less risky one. Thus, an investor will take on increased risk only if compensated by higher expected highers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, an investor who wants higher expected returns must accept more risk. The exact trade-off will be the same for all investors, but different investors will evaluate the trade-off differently based on individual risk aversion characteristics. The implication is that a rational investor will not invest in a portfolio if a second portfolio exist with more favorable risk-epected return profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theroy uses the standard deviation of return as a proxy for risk, which is valid if asset returns are jointly normally distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the portfolio return is the proption-weighted combination of the constituent assets&amp;rsquo; returns, the portfolio volatility is a function of the correlation, $\rho_{ij}$, of the component asset, for all asset pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the expected return, noted by the following formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$E(R_{p})=\sum_{i}w_{i}E(R_{i})$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$R_{p}$ is the return on the portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$R_{i}$ is the return on assets a particular asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$w_{i}$ is the weighting component of a particular asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portfolio return variance is denoted by the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\sigma_{p}^{2}=\sum_{i}w_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i}\sum_{j\neq i}w_{i}w_{j}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}\rho_{ij}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\rho_{ij}$ is the correlation between the returns on asset $i$ and $j$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the portfolio return volatility is merely the standard deviation of the porfolio return variance, such that $\sigma_{p}=\sqrt{\sigma_{p}^{2}}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can adjust the formula to adopt two asset portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio return:&lt;/strong&gt;  $\ w_{A}E(R_{A})+w_{B}E(R_{B})$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio variance:&lt;/strong&gt;  $\sigma_{p}^{2}=w_{A}^{2}\sigma_{A}^{2}+w_{B}^{2}\sigma_{B}^{2}+2w_{A}w_{B}\sigma_{A}\sigma_{B}\rho_{AB}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also do the same for the three asset portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Portfolio return: ** $\ w_{A}E(R_{A})+w_{B}E(R_{B})+w_{C}E(R_{C})$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Portfolio variance: ** $\ \sigma_{p}^{2}=w_{A}^{2}\sigma_{A}^{2}+w_{B}^{2}\sigma_{B}^{2}+w_{C}^{2}\sigma_{C}^{2}+2w_{A}w_{B}\sigma_{A}\sigma_{B}\rho_{AB}+2w_{A}w_{C}\sigma_{A}\sigma_{C}\rho_{AC}+2w_{B}w_{C}\sigma_{B}\sigma_{C}\rho_{BC}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;constructing-random-portfolios&#34;&gt;Constructing Random Portfolios&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we will begin with the construction of many different random portfolios. Why do we need a bunch of random portfolios? As mentioned previously, the purpose of the efficient frontier is to come up with a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest return for their defined level of risk. As such, we would need to come up with many different portfolios that potentially provide us with the highest return (if we&amp;rsquo;re risk-seeking) or the lowest risk (if we&amp;rsquo;re risk-averse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re already defined the formulas for portfolio return and variance. We can create a function that allows us to calculate these variables for our mutual fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be asking we we have multiplied the portfolio returns and variance by 252. We do this to annualize our variables. Asset prices are highly unpredictable, as they tend to change considerably through each day. It would be more benefitial for us to use the returns and variance over a specified time period, not just based on a single instance in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why multiply these variables by 252, instead of 365. While the number of trading days tend to vary through each year and from country to country, in the United States, there are an average of 252 trading days in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that we will not be using this function to construct our efficient portfolios directly. Rather, we will be using this function as a small part of a much larger function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, we will use the following function to calculate our list of random portfolios. We believe 500,000 random portfolios should be sufficient. We also need the risk free rate to calculate our sharpe ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Sharpe ratio&lt;/strong&gt; measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. The sharpe ratio can be calculated by the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$Sharpe\ Ratio\ =\ \frac{R_{p}-R_{f}}{\sigma_{p}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;strong&gt;risk-free rate&lt;/strong&gt;, it represents the rate of a hypothetical investment with no risk of financial loss, over a specific period of time. Since this rate cannot produce losses for the investor, any other investment would need to produce a higher return in order to induce investors to hold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-Year Treasury Note can be considered a proxy for the risk-free rate. At the time of writing this, the yield on the 10-Year Treasury is 3.10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/efficient_frontier_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Efficient Frontier 1&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, for a maximum return portfolio, we would need to allocate two-thirds of our budget on &lt;strong&gt;Oberweis Micro-Cap Fund (OBMCX)&lt;/strong&gt;. If you take a second look at the daily returns image that we&amp;rsquo;ve plotted earlier, you can see that OBMCX is very volatile. For the best return, our algorithm tells us that we should allocate a signficant portion of our budget to &lt;strong&gt;PRIMECAP Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund (POAGX)&lt;/strong&gt; as well. For a minimum risk portfolio, we can see that about 60% of our budget is allocated to &lt;strong&gt;Fairholme Focused Income Fund (FOCIX)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;efficient-frontier&#34;&gt;Efficient Frontier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the plot of the randomly selected simulated portfolios forms the shape of an arch line on the top of clustered blue dots. This line is referred to as the efficient frontier. We&amp;rsquo;ve used the term &amp;ldquo;efficient&amp;rdquo; quite often, but why is it considered efficient? It&amp;rsquo;s because the points along the line will give you the lowest risk for a given target return. All other dots below or to the right of the line will offer the same returns for more risk, or they offer less returns for the same amount of risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the two optimal portfolios by simulating many possible random choices and picking the best ones (either minimum risk or maximum risk-adjusted return). We can also implement this by using &lt;strong&gt;Scipy&amp;rsquo;s optimize function&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re an advanced Microsoft Excel user, you might be familiar with the solver function in Excel. Scipy&amp;rsquo;s optimize function is doing a similiar task when we are chosing what to optimize, as well as the constraints and the bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here on out, we will use the Scipy&amp;rsquo;s optimize function to determine the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio. However, there is no &amp;lsquo;maximize&amp;rsquo; option in the Scipy&amp;rsquo;s optimize function. So as an objective function, we need to pass something that should be minimized. That is why we have created the function &lt;code&gt;neg_sharpe_ratio&lt;/code&gt; for computing the negative Sharpe ratio. We use this as our objective to minimize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we want our function to return a negative sharpe ratio because the minimum value that our function function gives us would be the maximum sharpe ratio, which is what the function &lt;code&gt;max_sharpe_ratio&lt;/code&gt; will provide us. We first define arguments (this should not include the variables you would like to change for optimization, in this case, &amp;ldquo;weights&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

While we are trying to minimize volatility by trying different weights, the contraints and bounds are the same as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;returns_range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;efficients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;efficient_return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mean_returns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cov_matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;efficients&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we want to draw a line that depicts where efficient portfolios for a given level of risk. The functions above are to help compute efficient frontier. The first function, &lt;code&gt;efficient_return&lt;/code&gt;, is calculating the most efficient portfolio for a given target return, and the second function &lt;code&gt;efficient_frontier&lt;/code&gt; will take a range of target returns and compute efficient portfolio for each return level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/efficient_frontier_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Efficient Frontier 2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have almost the same result as what we have simulated by picking from randomly generated portfolios. The slight difference is that the Scipy&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;optimize&amp;rdquo; function has not allocated any budget for FOCIX, OBIOX, or SMPIX for the maximum sharpe ratio. For the minimum volatility, our algorithm tells us that we should allocate 59.11% in FOCIX, 33.76% in OBIOX, and 7.14% in OBMCX, while allocating nothing in the other two mutual funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot going on in this project, however, we&amp;rsquo;ve only really scratched the surface. We can use MPT to develop an asset pricing theory. Such pricing theories have paved the way for other applications, such as the &lt;strong&gt;Capital Asset Pricing Model&lt;/strong&gt;, or CAPM. Prehaps we can also create a model that allows us to backtest different portfolio weights to ensure the most efficient portfolio. This would be helpful, considering that the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s idea of a &amp;ldquo;efficient&amp;rdquo; portfolio is based on the historical asset pricing information of our selected asset class.&lt;/p&gt;
