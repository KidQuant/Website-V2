      <title>What&#39;s With Those Evil Beachgoers?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just when we thought were getting a handle on things during this pandemic, COVID-19 cases are surging again. With riots, protest, and businesses opening all across the country, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to pinpoint the extact cause. (after all, what is causing the increase in cases all depends on who you ask) [&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since we started reopening beaches during the peak of the corona-crisis, it seems like reporters in the media are trying to connect the dots between a surge in coronavirus cases, and the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeynep Tufekci has a point. It appears as though every single article that reports on a surge in cases is accompanied by a stock photo of a crowded beach. This is strange, because according to the Center for Diease Control, visiting the beach is probably one of the least risky activities you can engage with others.&lt;/p&gt;

What Experts Say May Depend on Who You Ask?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
