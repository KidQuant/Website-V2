      <title>How Dangerous Is Biking in New York City</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2024-03-31-biking-accidents/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/2024-03-31-biking-accidents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried analyzing cycling accidents around New York City, but it was difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. For example, men die more frequently than women while biking, according to a report on Bicyclist Fatalities and Serious Injuries in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, interpreting this data is tricky. For example, do more men die because more men bike or is it because they engage in riskier behavior? I had a different issue with analyzing accident locations (even though the data has geogrpahical location, longitude and latitude). Do more accidents happen at intersections because intersections are more dangerous or because they are easier locations to record? These kinds of questions are subtle and require careful data collection and analysis to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I found it hard to see how any conclusions would be actionable. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to start leaving work at 3 PM, even if 5 PM is a truly riskier time to bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Biking-Accidents/accidents.png&#34; alt=&#34;Biking Accidents in the city&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can I do? In my mind, the simplest framing is that biking is dangerous because I am sharing the road with cars. To justify this claim, consider these data from DOT&amp;rsquo;s Bicycle Crash Data Reports. They point a clear picture about the risk of accidents with and without cars. The simplest thing I can do is to plan my route to maximize time in bike lanes, ideally protected bike lanes. And I should be extra careful in moments where I interact with cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;estimating-the-risk&#34;&gt;Estimating The Risk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s calculate my risk. Let $X$ be a random variable denoting my lifetime. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that my only risk of death is via my commute and that dying occurs with probability $p$, where $p$ is the estimated KSI over my lifetime by biking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
p=\frac{30}{10,000,000}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An assumption here is that my risk of a severe injury or death on each ride is independent of all other rides. Often, independence assumptions are obviously false simplifications, but here I think it is reasonable. Without a concerted effort on my part to learn to bike more safely, I suspect that each ride carries roughly the same risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $X$ is a geometric random variable,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
X\sim\text{geom}(p),
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the probability that I do not make $x$ rides without severe injury or death is given by the cumulative distribution function,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\mathbb{P}(X\le 8000) = 1-\bigg(1-\frac{30}{10,000,000}\bigg)^{8000}\approx 2.4%.
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, this is conservative because $p$ and $x$ are both high in my mind. I doubt that I&amp;rsquo;ll bike to work this consistently over twenty years, and I also think (hope?) that NYC will become safer over time, that $p$ will actually decrease, driving biking infrastructure improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that while I&amp;rsquo;ve framed the calculation in terms of number of years commuting, the units of 8000 is simply &amp;ldquo;rides&amp;rdquo;. Thus, this risk is independent of time. If I decided to do 8000 rides in a single year, then I&amp;rsquo;d have a $2.4%$ chance of dying of biking in that year, according to these assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-sanity-check&#34;&gt;A Sanity Check&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sanity check, let&amp;rsquo;s find a value $p$ from the literature, and compare it to city&amp;rsquo;s data. I&amp;rsquo;d expect the probability of dying by cycling averaged over time and space to be less than the probability of dying by cycling in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to research, cycling twenty-eight miles has one micromort of risk. My commute&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COVID Vs. Economy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-08-22-covid-vs-economy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-08-22-covid-vs-economy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about the Mathematics of Pandemics. I&amp;rsquo;ve even talked about the Politics of Pandemics. I&amp;rsquo;m long overdue to discuss the &amp;ldquo;Economics of Pandemics;&amp;rdquo; however, theorizing the potential effects of an inadequate response was pretty pointless, as anyone who has lived through the Great Recession would tell you. After all, &amp;ldquo;ignorance on fire is sometimes better than knowledge on ice,&amp;rdquo; as the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not our economic response to COVID was sufficient, the discussion was always framed in a false dichotomy: protecting the vulnerable versus protecting the economy. If one is a pragmatic, normal-thinking individual, these two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. As early as March 27th, the IGM Chicago Forum surveyed more than 40 professional economists regarding the economic lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The vast majority of respondents agree (88%) believe that a comprehensive policy response would involve tolerating a massive contraction in economic activity until the spread has dropped significantly (Question A) [&lt;a href=&#34;#3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the United States, along with other nations around the world, instituted their lockdowns policy. We initiated our 15 Days to Slow The Spread, which quickly became 30 Days to Slow The Spread. Although most states have very minor COVID restrictions (staying six feet apart, no gatherings greater than 20 people, etc.), other places that were more severely affected are imposing more strict regulations. [&lt;a href=&#34;#4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;] It just so happens that the places with the strictest COVID regulation are also home to the largest economies in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most states have partially reopened (except for California), the U.S. economy contracted by a whopping -32.9% in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like a big number, that&amp;rsquo;s because it is a big number. The Bureau of Economic Analysis calculates GDP on an annualized basis; this facilitates comparison of growth rates over various periods. In other words, the -32.9% figure is what we would get if the economy sustained its growth (or, in this case, decline) for one year. When used to measure very short-term changes (such as locking down for one or two months), it can be misleading. As such, it&amp;rsquo;s probably better to use Year-over-year change, which would record a -9.5% decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-invisible-threat-ever-lurking&#34;&gt;An Invisible Threat Ever Lurking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how economic growth is measured, the catch-22 is unavoidable. COVID is so bad, it warrants locking down the economy to control its spread, but the economy is bad because we are locked down to prevent the spread of COVID. What a paradox&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the risk of infection is very real; we can&amp;rsquo;t expect things to go back to &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; if the risk of transmission is still high. Some would point out that the economic contraction was only severe &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; we failed to control the spread of COVID. The only problem with this theory is that the United States had the slowest contraction out of all the nations which successfully controlled the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/COVID-V-Economy/us_gdp_global.png&#34; alt=&#34;US vs Global GDP&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus ravaged Italy and Spain, and they have instituted strict lockdowns in return. Other places in Europe, which did not want to become the next Italy, instituted strict lockdowns. (Canada is included, for no other reason than it is our neighbor to the north) Some may argue that these nations made a significant trade-off; they chose to protect lives over the economy, and now the economy will be better off in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except now all of these places are relaxing their COVID restrictions and the virus is starting to spread again. Cases are starting to spike in France, while infections are slowly increasing in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/COVID-V-Economy/france_spain_covid.png&#34; alt=&#34;France and Spain&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following places are experiencing an uptick in COVID-19 cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Belgium, Neterlands, Switzerland, Greece, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Japan, Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do all of these places have in common? These regions were assumed to be in control of the virus [&lt;a href=&#34;#5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]. Now the virus is out of control and these regions are either experiencing a large surge (Japan), or a steady increase in cases (United Kingdom). Whether by pure luck or by a fortunate circumstance, the United States experienced a phenomenon in early June that Europe should have learned in early July: &lt;strong&gt;you can&amp;rsquo;t hide from the virus forever&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the lockdowns aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to last forever; they just need to be maintained until a vaccine is found [&lt;a href=&#34;#6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]. There&amp;rsquo;s no mention of when we can expect a COVID-19 anti-viral vaccine to be developed; &amp;ldquo;never&amp;rdquo; is a very realistic timeline for an effective vaccine (the flu vaccine has a 40-70% effectiveness). Regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s apparent that lockdown is not a sustainable strategy. For two reasons: 1) the obvious economic ramifications of keeping the economy locked down and 2) locking down just delays the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, we don&amp;rsquo;t have guidelines on what it means to reopen safely, or knowledge if this is even possible because the world has never been locked down before. Lockdown is a new concept that has never been tested for efficacy or implementation. Once the virus transmission restarts, the vulnerable and susceptible are still part of the population and will simply die later rather than sooner unless effective measures are taken to protect them. The only thing that can stop transmission of the virus long term is immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, locking down doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent an outbreak; it merely delays or pushes it out over a longer time frame depending on how severe the lockdowns were implemented. One may point out how South Korea infamously flattened the curve and controlled the spread of the virus. What really happened was that the region has been playing consistent whack-a-mole with outbreaks and on-off lockdowns. Despite implementing measures that would not be legal in the United States, the country is now experiencing a surge in cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/COVID-V-Economy/south_korea_cases.png&#34; alt=&#34;South Korea&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about New Zealand? Haven&amp;rsquo;t they eradicated the virus? They&amp;rsquo;ve managed to survive 100 days without a single COVID-19 transmission. Sure, New Zealand is a small island with a population of 5 million and a single major airport. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be difficult to suppress transmissions in the long-run; however, the virus eventually resurged without a single transmission from outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now confirmed cases have gone from an average of one per day to an average of 10 per day; Auckland is now back in lockdown; and their Prime Minister has delayed their national election [&lt;a href=&#34;#7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=&#34;#8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/COVID-V-Economy/new_zealand_cases.png&#34; alt=&#34;New Zealand&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a novel virus, which means that unless there is a vaccine, everyone will be exposed to it eventually. Keeping people locked inside doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop the disease; it only delays it. Unfortunately, keeping people locked inside until the spread slows down, or until vaccine, is a very popular solution to a very unsustainable problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;eventually-swedens-strategy-will-by-everyones-strategy&#34;&gt;Eventually Sweden&amp;rsquo;s Strategy Will By Everyone&amp;rsquo;s Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve barely mentioned Sweden in this post. As much of the Western world was shutting down large portions of the economy and limiting the mobility of its citizens throughout March, Sweden opted for a much lighter touch. They&amp;rsquo;ve refused to close down service industries, schools are largely left open, and its borders remained open to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmed cases spiked as high as 2,530 in a single day (1,247 per day on average); Sweden reached this milestone in early July. At the same time, fatalities have reached as high as 185, 107 per day on average, a milestone in early May. Both metrics have been on a downward trend since, on some recent days, the country has recorded as few as 3 COVID fatalities. The region is also currently averaging 253 new cases per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/COVID-V-Economy/sweden_cases_deaths.png&#34; alt=&#34;New Zealand&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockdowns and closed boarders lack a historical, scientific basis from the Swedish perspective. COVID-19 is in every European country, and so far, none of them have been able to slow down the spread considerably. Regardless, journalists and political analysts have considered Sweden a &amp;ldquo;cautionary tale&amp;rdquo; for the world [&lt;a href=&#34;#9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]. They justify this claim by correctly pointing out that Sweden&amp;rsquo;s population-adjusted death rate is significantly higher compared to its Scandinavian neighbors Finland, Denmark, and Norway [&lt;a href=&#34;#10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sweden ran into similar problems as many other places had in their attempts to control the virus through the least vulnerable population: failing to protect the elderly. According to most research, upwards of 70% of the COVID death toll in Sweden has been people in elderly care services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the same token, people 65 and older comprise 80% of all COVID deaths in the United States. U.S. Governors such as Andrew Cuomo have been heavily criticized by having the highest nursing home death toll in the U.S., despite instituted one of the strongest and most restrictive lockdowns in the country. Despite reaching Phrase Four of its reopening plan, much of the New York economy is still under lockdown; NYC&amp;rsquo;s mayor Bill DeBlasio is still enforcing strict social distancing requirements (except for protest, apparently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/COVID-V-Economy/sweden_outperforms.png&#34; alt=&#34;New Zealand&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of Sweden&amp;rsquo;s strategy, at least from Sweden&amp;rsquo;s perspective, is that places that have locked down significantly lower immunity levels than Sweden&amp;rsquo;s. As such, these places may need to lock down again if and when the disease returns (it has already returned). Many experts have claimed that COVID-19, like some other respiratory diseases, will only be subject to the effects of herd immunity when anywhere from 60-80% of the population recovers from it. No one knows what level of serology represents what is known as Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (NIT), but we do know that antibody studies are undercounting the population&amp;rsquo;s immunity [&lt;a href=&#34;#11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=&#34;#12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden&amp;rsquo;s steady decline in deaths and cases may present an advantage very few countries have obtained. Other hands that have managed to clamp down on infections are seeing a daily increase in cases. This suggests that other places around the world may have populations that may be more susceptible to the virus than Sweden. As such, Sweden&amp;rsquo;s economy may be better off in the long run without the on-and-off lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at Sweden, it may come across as insane that they&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take this approach. However, their approach was the basic science and standard pandemic response prior to 2020 [&lt;a href=&#34;#13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;]. With that being said, are &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; the insane ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, fall is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 on Retail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-08-15-covid-impact-retail-sales/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a genius to know that 2020 has been a year for the United States economy. Tens of millions were encouraged or forced to remain indoors in an attempt to slow the spread. Only a few industries/businesses were allowed to stay open, as they were classified as &amp;ldquo;essential businesses.&amp;rdquo; The longest expansion in U.S. history came to an end in Q1 2020, which resulted in a -5.0% contraction in economic activity (followed by a -32.9% drop in Q2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the same period, retail sales declined -0.87% YoY for Q1 2020, equating to a ~5 billion drop. During the second quarter, sales dropped a whopping 8.16% YoY, resulting in an approximately 12 billion decline in retail sales. (although the quarterly decline in sales is the largest since the Great Recession, the monthly decline is the largest in history)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, during the last two months, retail sales have recovered to pre-recession levels, and total sales are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/retailsales2020.png&#34; alt=&#34;Retail Sales&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everyone across the country is adjusting to a life with COVID, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see which industries benefit the most, and which industries are the most impacted. The Census Bureau publishes data on Advanced Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services; statistics are gathered utilizing a stratified random sampling method that tracks approximately 5,500 retail and food service firms. The data is then weighted and benchmarked to represent a complete universe of over three million retail and food service firms. The data goes as far back as 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/monthly_retail_sales_2020.png&#34; alt=&#34;Monthly Retail Sales 2020&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw a slight decline in February, which can be seen as a result of seasonality (a decline as a result of holiday shopping MoM). However, during the two months afterward, we&amp;rsquo;ve experienced some extreme declines in retail sales, most of which occurred in April. Most states haven&amp;rsquo;t instituted their lockdowns until the end of March or the beginning of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;retail-sales-pre-lockdown&#34;&gt;Retail Sales Pre-Lockdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2020, retail sales declined -0.44% MoM. The only industries which experienced growth were general merchandise, sporting goods/hobby stores, pharmacies/drug stores, fuel dealers, beer/liquor stores, electronic retail, and nonstore retailers. Nonstore retailers are essentially any business the primarily sells merchandise online, the industry with the largest monthly growth of 1.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/february_2020.png&#34; alt=&#34;February Sales&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant declines include gasoline stations (-2.95%), men&amp;rsquo;s clothing stores (-2.86%), automotive parts (-2.38%), general clothing stores (-1.8%), and building material/suppliers dealers (-1.63%). Out of 30 NAICS industries, just seven experienced sales growth for the entire month of February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;retail-sales-post-lockdown&#34;&gt;Retail Sales Post-Lockdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, retail sales declined -14.7%; just two industries are experiencing growth during the lockdown: electronic shopping/mail-order houses and nonstore retailers. To be expected, as non-essential businesses are forced to close down, and people are encouraged to work from home if they are able. Social distancing policies instituted by state and local governments fueled demand for products designed to help people work from home and keep in contact with loved ones, such as computers, webcams, desks, monitors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/april_2020.png&#34; alt=&#34;April Sales&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would also assume that industries such as grocery and fast food would see some growth during this period, considering these are classified as essential businesses. However, grocery and fast food industries experienced a -13.37% and -34.32% decline, respectively. This decline could be attributed to safety concerns (unable to implement the necessary infrastructure to continue operating safely). It could be due to the decrease in mobility (many of the food and drinking places include restaurants and bars, which people can no longer patronize).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that both of these industries took a subtaintial hit. There is a reason why the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) allowed even large resturant chains to recieve loans, despite the program being designed specifically for small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the United States is a service-oriented economy. Fewer people moving around generally implies fewer money-making opportunities for businesses, regardless of industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;retail-sales-after-reopening&#34;&gt;Retail Sales After Reopening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;reopening&amp;rdquo; is a somewhat subjective term at this point, we can say that relative to the initial lockdowns, most states have started to liberalize their economies. Like Florida, most states lifted its lockdown at the beginning of May, while others such as New York and New Jersey waited until the beginning of June. Some states, such as South Dakota, never instituted a lockdown at all. As such, we can spot the growth of the recovery at the exact movement states began to reopen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/may_2020.png&#34; alt=&#34;May Sales&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During May, Retail sales grew 18.27%, which shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising to anyone if you shut down the economy for nearly two months. Also, every industry experienced sales growth, which also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising. If you&amp;rsquo;re at rock bottom, the only place left to go is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/top_sales_may_2020.png&#34; alt=&#34;Top 10 Sales&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 5 industries with the most growth in May include shoe stores, clothing accessories, clothing stores, women&amp;rsquo;s clothing, and sporting goods. An obvious explanation would consist of the resurgence of warmer weather. People are forced to remain inside, and it&amp;rsquo;s challenging to keep doing in a more temperate climate. Plenty of clothing stores also reopened just in time for the summer season; so the surge in sales also coincides a change in climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A not so obvious explanation would include a change in habits such as eating and exercising. Being forced to remain indoors, we&amp;rsquo;re probably eating more than usual and not exercising as often (considering the gyms are closed). Combined with all of the stress that everyone is going through, people are most likely gaining more weight. As such, they are probably shopping for clothes that fit or making adjustments to a current wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-most-covid-proof-industries&#34;&gt;The Most COVID-Proof Industries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the investing world, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to find industries that are &amp;ldquo;recession-proof.&amp;rdquo; Finding industries that are immune to pandemics, COVID in particular, is especially tricky. We want to figure out which industries performed the best ( or worse) during the first half of 2020. For this, we&amp;rsquo;re going to calculate the percentage change from January to June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/percentage_change_retail.png&#34; alt=&#34;Change Retail Sales&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you were in the business of selling electronics and sporting goods, you most likely saw a lot of business. Interestingly, people have pointed out that liquor stores are not an essential business but noticed they were exempt from many shelters in place orders. There are most likely technical reasons for this (alcohol is still technically food), historical reasons (the prohibition era), and personal reasons (it helps reduces stress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you owned a department store, a place where clothing and general appliances were sold, or if you owned a bar/restaurant, you most likely lost a lot of money. This is understandable; if you want to prevent the spread of a deadly virus, then you&amp;rsquo;re not going to keep places where people have to be within close proximity open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/online_retail.png&#34; alt=&#34;Change Retail Sales&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, we see a temporary bifurcation of the retail market. For as long as we are following CDC safety guidelines, only industries that are considered the most &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; and essential will outperform. If your business requires people to travel, be near one another, and require physical inventory, these industries will most likely take a hit until we&amp;rsquo;ve controlled the spread of this virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we need consider the possibility that some of the businesses that were forced to close may never repoen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the current situation has made the traditional way of engaging in commerce inconvenient, plenty of businesses have found ways to accommodate their customers (such as no-contact delivery). These days, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to have an online presence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cancel Culture, Woke Capitalism, and the Market Place of Ideas</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-08-15-hashtag-activism-redux/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-08-15-hashtag-activism-redux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a familiar proverb often cited in politics, which states something to the effect of, &amp;ldquo;if you&amp;rsquo;re not outraged, you&amp;rsquo;re not paying attention.&amp;rdquo; I often say, as a response, if politics is functioning normally, the average person is not supposed to be paying attention. Everyone in politics has a habit of engaging in hyperbole; attributing nefarious intent towards their rivals; comparing our daily lives to political dramas like &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt;. In reality, with the apparent exception of the year 2020, life is very dull. Politics is more similar to shows like &lt;em&gt;VEEP&lt;/em&gt;; it&amp;rsquo;s mostly a joke, which would explain why most Americans don&amp;rsquo;t take it as seriously as others would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, most Americans don&amp;rsquo;t have well-formed political identities and don&amp;rsquo;t want one. They say if &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t Vote&amp;rdquo; was a candidate for President during the 2016 general election, it would have won in a landslide [&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. When you consider that most people are not very political, an attempt to politicize everything becomes very poisonous. Once upon a time, people engaged in the activities they enjoyed. Now, the daily actions of individuals require them to engage a sort of political calculus. Similar to the &amp;ldquo;Rational Expectations&amp;rdquo; implication economist implement in theoretical models. When making decisions, the theory states that individual agents will base their decisions on the best possible information available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political universe, at least political Twitter, operates under a similar notion, albeit with a faulty premise. The assumption is that everyone is politically active, has access to all news information, and aware of all political/cultural tropes. While it&amp;rsquo;s flattering to assume that your fellow countryman is as politically aware as the next, the opportunity cost of remaining an informed citizen is very high. You can&amp;rsquo;t attribute every action to some nefarious political motivation. Sometimes, people are just trying to live their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;woke-capitalism&#34;&gt;Woke Capitalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The late Economist Milton Freidman said it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy. It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another.&amp;rdquo; - Why Government is the Problem&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman&amp;rsquo;s statement was made during a much simpler time. Who knows what he would think of the abomination has morphed into &amp;ldquo;Woke Capitalism.&amp;rdquo; First of all, what the hell does the term &amp;ldquo;woke&amp;rdquo; mean? It should be noted that I don&amp;rsquo;t use this term, and I have no desire to use it in the future. If you want to figure out what it means, you just look it up yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/meme-companies-woke-capitalism.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Work capitalism&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Woke Capitalism&amp;rdquo; has a different connotation, depending on who uses it. Woke Capitalism can be referred to as an approach to how Corporations capitalize on popular social movements to increase their bottom line. The very polarizing Gillette commercial against toxic masculinity is one example [&lt;a href=&#34;#2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. Companies/brands changing their logo to incorporate rainbow colors every Pride month is another. It&amp;rsquo;s often seen as shilling and insincere, but some have argued that companies failing to address these issues imply they value profits over people. Damned if you do; damned if you don&amp;rsquo;t. There are many other examples, but I&amp;rsquo;m referring to a different kind of woke capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of woke capitalism I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the reverse of free-market capitalism Freidman lionized. In Woke Capitalism, race, sex, gender, religion, ethnicity, and many other factors determine how goods and services are produced. These factors all determine what goods and services are acceptable to purchase. Instead of working together, despite your differences, you work against one another because of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, these factors will even decide who is allowed to participate in the market. In an open market, resources are allocated toward practical and lucrative ideas. Woke Capitalism doesn&amp;rsquo;t even allow the market to discuss ideas, at least not contrarian ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-marketplace-of-ideas&#34;&gt;The Marketplace of Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often say, &amp;ldquo;sunlight is the best disinfectant,&amp;rdquo; which implies that truly objectionable ideas or &amp;ldquo;bad speech&amp;rdquo; should not be censored out principle. Instead, when given the opportunity, people should have a chance to examine these ideas. If they&amp;rsquo;re as terrible as one claims, people will become aware that others hold these opinions, and object to these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This philiophy can loosely be referred to as &lt;em&gt;The Marketplace of Ideas&lt;/em&gt;. The rationale is based on the premise that truth will emerge from the competition of ideas, when people are allowed to engage in public discourse [&lt;a href=&#34;#3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]. Early usage of this term are attributed to philiophiers, such as John Milton and John Stuart Mills; I first discovered it listening to Dave Ruben [&lt;a href=&#34;#4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruben is a proponent of the freedom of expression, which should come as no surprise given the type of guest he has had on his show. Ruben believes, as long as we stand for the principles of free speech, values such as truth, logic, and reason will ultimately win in The marketplace of ideas. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to discuss whether I agree with this principle. Even if I grant the premise that we have &amp;ldquo;a marketplace of ideas,&amp;rdquo; like finance/economics, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand what type of market we&amp;rsquo;re operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market isn&amp;rsquo;t very open, free, or competitive, considering the platforms people have to go through to disseminate an original thought. We also have the opportunity to review &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; viewpoints, so it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a monopoly. I can&amp;rsquo;t precisely describe the type of marketplace that we are using to exchange our ideas. What I can say is that, regardless of how it functions, it is one-sided and rigged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/cato_survey.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Cato National Survye&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent National Survey poll by the Cato Institute has found that 62% of American adults feel that the current political climate prevents people from saying things they believe. The majority of people, sorted by political affiliation, agree with this sentiment [&lt;a href=&#34;#5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]. The only cohort which disagrees with this sentiment are Strong Liberal, which would most likely include the far left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also worth noting that the Cato survey tracks respondents over time. For the first time in three years, the majority of moderate liberals feel that the current political climate is too toxic to share political opinions with others. If the only people who feel &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; sharing their opinions are strong liberals, then its a clear indication that the benefits of free expression are asymmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancel-culture&#34;&gt;Cancel Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancel culture has only managed to intensify these issues. Although we have yet to develop an agreed-upon definition for the term, I would define cancel culture as the public shaming and calling out of individuals for something that is considered to be &amp;ldquo;problematic.&amp;rdquo; The transgressions eventually lead to the individual losing employment opportunities, future event invitations (current even cancellations), or other benefits customarily distributed based on merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples are countless; they include Economist Harald Uhlig, who lost his position at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement [&lt;a href=&#34;#6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]. The termination came in the wake of a petition by two other economists, Paul Krugman and Justin Wolfers, who spearheaded a petition to remove Uhlig as lead editor from the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Political Economy&lt;/em&gt;. The publication has launched a full investigation into Uhlig and has found no wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/BLM_support.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;BLM Support&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have David Shor, a data analyst for Civis Analyst, a Democrat polling firm. He was fired from his position for providing the data detailing the election after the King assassination riots of 1968 [&lt;a href=&#34;#7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]. He pointed out that the civil unrest helped tip the scales in favor of President Richard Nixon, who was ultimately not sympathetic to civil rights issues. Shor suggested that the George Floyd riots could do the same for Trump in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence to suggest this hypothesis is true. CIVIQS has historically tracked the online sentiment of online registered voters for the Black Lives Matter movement [&lt;a href=&#34;#8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]. Since the recent killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbrey, and George Floyd, support for Black Lives Matter surged 10 points to 52% in late May. Two months later, the opposition has risen 9 points to 37%, while support has declined below 50%. Based on this survey, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the patience for the movement among the electorate is limited. Rioting alienates people, but in the era of cancel culture, you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to entertain the possibility of riots&amp;rsquo; counterintuitive nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the most hilarious, and yet egregious example of cancel culture involves the firing of a San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric company employee named Emmanuel Cafferty. His sin is flashing what appeared to be an &amp;ldquo;okay&amp;rdquo; hand gesture, which anti-racist groups say it&amp;rsquo;s a white-supremacist hand gesture. Nevermind the fact that Cafferty works in a diverse community, has Mexican ancestry, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t remotely appear to be white [&lt;a href=&#34;#9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter; cancel culture can&amp;rsquo;t let the details and facts get in the way of a good outrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of examples involve individuals who work in Academica or the Media. However, the cases I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned involve regular individuals like myself, which suggest no one is immune to being canceled. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any data to support my assertions, but I would bet that most cases involve progressive outrage. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily suggest that progressives/liberals are immune; they&amp;rsquo;re just as susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recent example involves a recent Harvard graduate named Claira Janover, an incoming analyst at Deloitte, one of the big four accounting firms [&lt;a href=&#34;#10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;]. She had her job offer rescinded after a controversial TikTok video, claiming that she would stab anyone who has &amp;ldquo;the nerve, the sheer entitled Caucasity [sic] to say &amp;lsquo;All Lives Matter.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; She also said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo; ma stab you, and while you&amp;rsquo;re struggling and bleeding out, I&amp;rsquo; ma show you my paper cut and say, &amp;lsquo;My cut matters, too.&amp;rdquo; The statement had a dual purpose: 1) it was an obvious joke, 2) it was an analogy, explaining that although &amp;ldquo;All Lives Matter,&amp;rdquo; black lives are the ones who need the most help. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter; it&amp;rsquo;s offensive, and Deloitte informed Janover that she lost what she considered her &amp;ldquo;dream job.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander; cancel culture also harms progressive movements. We need to ensure everyone, regardless of whether we agree with what they say, can freely express themselves without worrying about people going after their livelihoods. Perhaps we should use cancel culture as a weapon, so people will understand how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a viable solution? If one genuinely believes we have a &amp;ldquo;marketplace of ideas,&amp;rdquo; then the obvious answer to this question is &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a real marketplace, firms compete vigorously for your business. This means firms need to work hard to innovate, improve the marketability of goods and services, and please customers. As a result, firms hate competition and will look for whatever edge they can get to push them ahead of the competition, whether it&amp;rsquo;s government regulation, rent-seeking activities, or corporate welfare. We&amp;rsquo;re not suggesting which attributes the market should or should not have. These are the attributes the market currently has, whether you like it or not. As long as these features exist, firms will take advantage; it&amp;rsquo;s no different from the marketplace of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is the principled approach; some free speech advocates believe using the same tactics only legitimizes the practice. I am very sympathetic to this view. However, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the reality; cancel culture is a feature of the marketplace that some people will use, while others will not. We can think of this conundrum in terms of what I like to call &amp;ldquo;The Buffett Paradox.&amp;rdquo; Warren Buffet consistently complains about the U.S. tax code, how the rich only benefit from it and suggests that taxes should be raised on the wealthy. Most people are unaware that Buffet goes out of his way to make sure that he is taxed at the lowest rate possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, Buffett only pays himself an annual salary of $100,000 as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) [&lt;a href=&#34;#11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to my annual salary, and I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of nothing and no one. Most people know that majority of Buffett&amp;rsquo;s wealth is in his company&amp;rsquo;s stock. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t know that since Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate, it takes advantage of what is known as a dividend-received deduction (DRD). With a DRD, the amount of taxes BRK pays in
dividends can be reduced, based on the percentage of ownership BRK has of each company in its portfolio. [&lt;a href=&#34;#12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]. Then there is the controversy with carried interests that President Trump blasted Buffet for when he was candidate Trump [&lt;a href=&#34;#13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I&amp;rsquo;m getting at with this drawn-out Warren Buffett analogy is that the principled approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t always win hearts and minds. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder to convince others that you&amp;rsquo;re principled when you&amp;rsquo;re just a massive hypocrite like Buffett. However, there are ideals, and then there&amp;rsquo;s pragmatism. In a real marketplace, rich people are good and remaining rich, and Warren Buffett is one of the smartest rich people I know. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for wealthy people like Buffett to advocate for raising taxes on principle when they know they have the resources to ensure the Government will never touch any real money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true for how woke capitalist function within the marketplace of ideas. They care naught for market efficiency or asymmetric information; they only care about staying ahead of the game, while keeping its opponents at bay. People can try and pin their hopes on some return to common sense and civility. Maybe this will happen when cancel culture eventually comes for those who once contributed to it. It&amp;rsquo;s not outside the realm of possibility; however, the examples of this occurring are very thin [&lt;a href=&#34;#14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;]. Sure, perhaps one day, eventually, participants in this marketplace of ideas will return to a state of rationality. However, as John Mayard Keynes once said, &amp;ldquo;The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;market-regulation&#34;&gt;Market Regulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate regarding cancel culture shifted into two factions. One faction involves a group of people who believe it is a growing concern among people who believe in the right of free expression [&lt;a href=&#34;#15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;]. The other consists of a group of people who believe the following [&lt;a href=&#34;#16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancel culture isn&amp;rsquo;t a thing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a serious problem, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not so much &amp;ldquo;cancel culture,&amp;rdquo; as more like holding people accountable for what they say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment of the United States prevents the government from regulating speech. The First Amendment does not prevent businesses from controlling their own employees&amp;rsquo; expression, nor does it protect individuals from the political pressure and speech from members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people call it &amp;ldquo;speaking truth to power,&amp;rdquo; but speaking truth to power implies that someone is offering valid criticism. Punitiveness, de-platforming, and boycotting are all characteristics of mob tactics. Proximately one year ago, I talked about &lt;code&gt;#cancelsoulcycle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;boycottequinox&lt;/code&gt;; this year, we have &lt;code&gt;#boycottgoya&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevermind the fact that Goya Foods is not a publicly-traded company. The justification for boycotting a minority-owned business is&amp;hellip; the CEO publicly suggesting that the Trump Administration was not a complete disaster for the Latin-American community [&lt;a href=&#34;#17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as cancel culture remains a zero-sum game, people will be punished or fired for meaningless and imaginary transgressions. People who are traditionally against government intervention must concede that this calls for a more legislative remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;protections-for-lawful-political-activity&#34;&gt;Protections for Lawful Political Activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people believe the way to mitigate the problems with cancel culture is to rein in at-will employment. At-Will employment is a contract that states that both the employer or employee may terminate an agreement at any time for any reason, as long as it isn&amp;rsquo;t illegal. A firm can&amp;rsquo;t terminate an employee for being a woman or a minority. However, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee for being a Biden supporter or Trump donor, as political affiliation isn&amp;rsquo;t a protected class. (The same Cato National Survey found that 35% of conservatives would support firing Biden donors; 50% of liberals support firing Trump donors)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People wrongly assume that employment is a one-way street, and that firms hold all of the cards when it comes to hiring talent. The problem is not that at-will employment is too flexible for employers. Instead, elements such as severance and termination conditions need to be clearly outlined, defined and negotiated between employers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, one of my gigs involved working as a market researcher for a startup. It involved at-will employment; traditional elements such as professional expectations and compensation were outlined. However, the contract also included provisions for political engagement, which I thought was interesting. The agreement stated that the firm &amp;ldquo;does not discriminate based on political affiliation or creed; however, it will also not punish for engaging in lawful political activity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local examples show how mandating these protections should also work. Section § 2-1401.01 of Washington D.C.&amp;rsquo;s Human Rights Law prevents discrimination based on many characteristics, including (but not limited to) political affiliation or an endorsement of any political party [&lt;a href=&#34;#18&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]. Seattle also has laws that discriminate based on political ideology, which it defines as an idea or belief &amp;ldquo;relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government and related institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;#19&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some scenarios in which these protections could easily backfire, such as an advocacy group being forced to employ someone who opposes the organization&amp;rsquo;s goals (e.g., pro-choice advocacy groups forced to hire pro-life advocates) Obviously, non-profit organizations would need clearly defined exemptions from this provisions. It&amp;rsquo;s unreasonable to expect firms to take on candidates who aren&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for the organizational culture. On the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s also unreasonable for firms to terminate employees based on the whims of public pressure or characteristics which have nothing to do with employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting that employers should learn to tolerate employees creating a hostile work environment, such as intolerance against minorities. People have argued that this is the type of environment Claira Janover would have fostered with taunts about &amp;ldquo;stabbing&amp;rdquo; anyone who disagrees with the &amp;ldquo;Black Lives Matter&amp;rdquo; philosophy, justifying her termination. We can also address this issue with legislation. Seattle&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Unfair Public Accommodations and Practices&lt;/em&gt; definition of a political ideology includes conduct that reasonably relates to political ideology and does not &amp;ldquo;cause substantial and material disruption of the property rights of the provider of a place of public accommodation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancel-culture-culture-and-smash-woke-capitalism&#34;&gt;Cancel &amp;ldquo;Culture Culture&amp;rdquo; and Smash &amp;ldquo;Woke Capitalism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere within the last decade or so, certain groups have decided they&amp;rsquo;ve won the culture war. Many of the things we all thought were fine just became unacceptable. Most people are not even aware of the existence of this &amp;ldquo;culture war.&amp;rdquo; Regardless, this war seems to have many casualties, not limited to 1) people who fail to understand the rules of engagement or 2) the belief that some will be immune from the rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to markets, rules, and regulations (or the Rule of Law) is essential for any marketplace to function adequately. Suppose market participants can&amp;rsquo;t find or figure out the law. In that case, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to invest in real estate, build up inventory, engage in long-term contracts, or even engage in simple barter. The marketplace of ideas works very similar in this regard; if the rules of what is acceptable to say constantly changes, people will stop speaking their minds [&lt;a href=&#34;#20&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps this is the outcome those who engage in &amp;ldquo;cancel culture&amp;rdquo; would prefer. To paraphrase a common talking point among social activists, &amp;ldquo;why be racist, sexist, homophobic, et al. when you can just be quiet?&amp;rdquo; This is perfectly easy to do in our current political climate. Everything is racist, everything is sexist, everything is homophobic, and there is always going to be a group of moral busy-bodies who are going to point it all out, even when no one is asked [&lt;a href=&#34;#21&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand, in a marketplace, regardless of the type of market, those who fail to adapt will be left behind. Those who fail to innovate will be left in a perpetual state of playing catch-up, possibly for a generation. It is important, now more than ever, that we expand protections in the workplace. While people who are more politically conservative are less interested in the regulation of employment, they must also recognize that these reforms would protect them from the growing influence of cancel culture. People who also identify as liberals would also benefit from these protections, as they are not immune from the public pressure from outrage culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societies advance because the majority of citizens believe we all need progress together. That progress occurs with more conversation, not less. But, if ordinary people fear that a minor infraction, tiny misunderstanding, or even a difference of opinion might cost them their job, they will be less likely to agree with the change. As George Leonard once said, &amp;ldquo;Resistance is proportional to the size and speed of the change, not to whether the change is favorable or unfavorable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If lessons from 2016 have taught as anything, labeling people convince them to change their behavior, but not their beliefs. Will we learn from our past mistakes?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Politics of Pandemics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-07-11-the-politics-of-pandemics/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-07-11-the-politics-of-pandemics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bet you&amp;rsquo;d never thought we&amp;rsquo;d find a way to politicize a deadly virus. I suppose that is what happens when your government operates under a system of federalism [&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as if people are just now realizing, when it comes to specific issues, that the state and local governments are more important than the federal government. In some ways, this crisis may have renewed our appreciation for the federalist system of government. In others, it has also magnified the polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo stated on Twitter that, &amp;ldquo;We [NY State] didn&amp;rsquo;t just flatten the curve &amp;ndash; we crushed it.&amp;rdquo; This statement isn&amp;rsquo;t remotely true, for reasons that I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined [&lt;a href=&#34;#2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. Of course, I never realized at the time how much this statement would be used as a launching pad for the &amp;ldquo;blue states vs. red state&amp;rdquo; mantra. (Even during the early months of the Pandemic, it was &amp;ldquo;blue state vs. red state&amp;rdquo; in terms of testing, reopening, and a few other issues)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why not use a pandemic as an opportunity to advance that agenda, especially since Twitter makes it so easy for certain people to get away with being mildly dishonest. (To a certain degree, Twitter &amp;ldquo;fact-checks&amp;rdquo; post on their platform)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/deleted_post.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;infectives origin&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the evidence does Neera Tanden use to support this claim? Who could say? It is, after all, just a talking point, but is there any basis for this claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stating such a claim would require us to ignore some basic facts, such as 45% of all COVID-19 deaths originates in just four states (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and California). You&amp;rsquo;d also have to ignore the fact that California, Colorado, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, and Nevada are all experiencing a surge in cases, along with most states in the country. (These are all &amp;ldquo;blue states,&amp;rdquo; in case you were wondering.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is not to say that, “Democrats and their partisan-politics are beyond the pale.” It’s certainly not beneath Republicans to engage in the same sort of distasteful rhetoric [&lt;a href=&#34;#3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]. The point is, under our highly polarizing circumstances, we have become our source for false information. An Oxford study has found, when given accurate statistics on controversial issues, people tend to misremember those numbers to help align with commonly held beliefs [&lt;a href=&#34;#4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here is a fact that most people don&amp;rsquo;t know: it was primarily travel &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; New York City that seeded the wave of U.S. outbreaks for the rest of the country [&lt;a href=&#34;#5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the New York Times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York City’s coronavirus outbreak grew so large by early March that the city became the primary source of new infections in the United States, new research reveals, as thousands of infected people traveled from the city and seeded outbreaks around the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The research indicates that a wave of infections swept from New York City through much of the country before the city began setting social distancing limits to stop the growth. That helped to fuel outbreaks in Louisiana, Texas, Arizona and as far away as the West Coast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied the genetic samples of infected individuals from many different parts of the country. They&amp;rsquo;ve found that the majority of infectives were exposed by people traveling from New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to discover where the primary vectors originate by looking at the genetic code of the virus. Viruses tied to New York have a distinct genetic signature that links them to outbreaks in Europe. In contrast, the spread from Washington State has a signature that connects directly to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following graphic shows the breakdown between the genetic samples that originate from Washington State (yellow bars) or New York City (red bars). It is well known that the earliest confirmed cases were originally found in these two areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/infectives_origin.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;infectives origin&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the vast majority of the spread is associated with an outbreak in New York City, with very little originating from Washington. This is not the say that the spread of the virus was primarily domestic (the virus was still brought into America, from abroad). However, the idea &amp;ldquo;the whole country could be seeing their surges&amp;rdquo; if the earliest of confirmed cases appeared in states like Texas is nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, New York City alone has ~65 million visitors at any given year, both domestic and international. The largest domestic markets originate in visitors from the NYC Metro Area (New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania), Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., and California (specifically, Los Angeles) [&lt;a href=&#34;#6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]. Considering a large amount of international and domestic travel occurs in New York City, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how NYC was the primary vector for the domestic spread. After all, the spread occurred between residents leaving the city and non-residents who passed through the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would things be different if the earliest of confirmed cases were found in Texas? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to say. Texas has its fair share of visitors, as it shares a broader with Mexico. Many of the students who went to Mexico for spring break contracted the virus and spread it among the population in Texas [&lt;a href=&#34;#7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not very likely that the virus would have traveled very far, even if the outbreak did start in Texas instead of New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;em&gt;Mathematics of Pandemics&lt;/em&gt;, the politics are relatively simple. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any understanding of Ordinary Differential Equations; no fundamental understanding of probability; you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to use arithmetic [&lt;a href=&#34;#8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]. One merely needs to be married to an ideology, vilify their opposition, and present their ideas in the best possible light, regardless of how these poorly thought-out ideas end up infecting (pun intended) our political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as people reflect and understand how they&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at their flawed conclusions, being wrong isn&amp;rsquo;t the worst thing in the world. However, too often in our political system, we find that the price for being wrong is often paid for by other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the perks of being part of a &amp;ldquo;think-tank,&amp;rdquo; I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tweet in question no longer exists. Assuming Tanden decided to come to her senses and delete such a terrible take. No worries, as I’ve managed to preserve what is left of the post, and the tweet in question is documented in major news publications [&lt;a href=&#34;#9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No, New York Has Not Flattened The Curve</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-06-08-ny-crushed-by-curve/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-06-08-ny-crushed-by-curve/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep reading &amp;ndash; and hearing &amp;ndash; that New York has successfully &amp;ldquo;flattened the curve,&amp;rdquo; and it makes me wonder if people have just decided to go into hibernation the past three months. It&amp;rsquo;s not outside the realm of possibility; we all have lots of free time on our hands now. However, it&amp;rsquo;s a sign that our political discourse has become so warped that our politicians can say things that are patently false with very little pushback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- tweet 1269344344374497280 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I expect? As a politician, he&amp;rsquo;s not going to say, &amp;ldquo;New York has been decimated by the virus,&amp;rdquo; but that&amp;rsquo;s precisely what happened. I haven&amp;rsquo;t talked about &amp;ldquo;flatten the curve&amp;rdquo; at all on this blog because it assumed that it was well understood by most. I was obviously wrong. How else can a governor of one of the largest states get away from saying, &amp;ldquo;we crushed&amp;rdquo; the curve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-flatten-the-curve-even-mean&#34;&gt;What Does &amp;ldquo;Flatten The Curve&amp;rdquo; Even Mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flatten The Curve is an objective, which refers to the &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo; epidemiological curve. What it means is that instead of the rate of rising being very rapid, perhaps a doubling in cases every 4 - 7 days, we cut the doubling to every 2 - 3 weeks. The purpose of flattening the curve was to prevent an overwhelming of the health care system, so health care professionals can find more effective ways of treating infected patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/pandemic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pandemic Curves&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following image shows what a flattened curve should obviously look like. The red-shaded steap curve shows a scenario with preventative measures (social distancing, mask, etc.), while blue-shaded curve shows a scenario with protective measures. The blue-shaded curve is flatter than the red-shaded curve, and that is the scenario that we are trying to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how I didn&amp;rsquo;t say any of this &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; happen, because there is no guarantee that that it should. There are other factors that we may fail to consider and you&amp;rsquo;ll know you&amp;rsquo;re at the peak until you&amp;rsquo;ve reached it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happened? Did we get the blue-shaded flat curve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month or so ago, I did a project on tracking COVID-19 cases globally; part of that analysis involved looking at different U.S. States [&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. Around that time, cases in New York were doubling every 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today New York, the increase in cases is relatively stable, trending at ~1,200 additional cases a day. However, during the early days of the pandemic, the New York average around 10,000-12,000 additional cases day. The state was probably responsible for at least 30 percent of all new coronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/new_york_cases_0704.png&#34; alt=&#34;New York Cases&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to answer a previously-posed question, no, we did not get the blue-shaded flat curve, synonymous with a gradual increase in new infections. Instead, what we witness was a rapid spike in daily cases. At least, when compared to cases in Washington State, which did experience a large surge in cases but managed to taper off early during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/washington_cases_0704.png&#34; alt=&#34;New York Cases&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is all in the past. New York is doing relatively better now, even as cases surge in places that were previously managing the virus well. So, what exactly is New York doing that is so special? It&amp;rsquo;s not as if New York is doing anything spectacular when it comes to testing or tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing that happened&amp;hellip; was the virus rushed through the most susceptible people in the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my post, &lt;em&gt;The Mathematics of Pandemics&lt;/em&gt;, I laid out the framework as to why you can prove (mathematically) that the virus always dies out [&lt;a href=&#34;#2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. (susceptible people get exposed; exposure becomes an infection; infectives either recover or die) It doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen when the disease infects everyone in the population, or when the pathogen mutates into something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple reality is that contact between the remaining infectives and susceptibles become so infrequent that the infectives never get a chance to pass on the disease before being removed from the equation (recovering with immunity or dying). The virus dies due to the lack of infectives, not the lack of susceptibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, this has happened (is happening) in New York. Several factors can increase the risk of the susceptibility of COVID-19; however, we know that the disease is more susceptible to individuals over the age of +65-years-old. We can see from the data, the death rate for people age 65 and over is more than ten times higher than for people under 65-years-old [&lt;a href=&#34;#3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if your objective is to flatten the curve starting March, you would expect to see a steady increase in the number of infections, spread out over months. If you failed to flatten the curve, you saw a huge spike in cases, followed by a massive spike of fatalities, followed by a rapid decrease, as we saw here in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting this in perspective, if the State of New York were a country, it would have the highest death rate in the world. That&amp;rsquo;s not a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/nyc_deaths.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;New York Deaths&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are noticing a surge in cases in other parts of the country, places that have yet to experience their first wave (Flordia and Arizona). Deaths in these states are relatively small. The death rate from COVID-19 is ~170 per 100,000 people in New York State [&lt;a href=&#34;#4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;], Arizona has reported ~1,000 COVID deaths. For Arizona to have a death rate comparable to New York, there would need to be +11,200 additional deaths from COVID in Arizona, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely. (Florida would need to have +35,000 new deaths)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the state begins its Phase One plan for reopening the economy, it is unlikely to result in a huge surge in cases. However, cases will eventually start rising again. Once it does, will New Yorkers &lt;em&gt;tolerate&lt;/em&gt; another lockdown?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measuring Pandemic Progress: Log Scale vs. Per Capita</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-04-15-measuring-covid-progress/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/post/2020-04-15-measuring-covid-progress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been many visualization projects created for the purposes of modeling COVID-19 cases and deaths. The best known are the graphs produced by John Burn-Murdock of the Financial Times. You can view his very create and beautiful COVID visualizations on his Twitter Page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before COVID, I think people were more used to viewing data in relative terms. Now, log-scale visualizations have become more widespread, primarily due to the way diseases spread during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s become so popular, programmers developed ways to replicate these charts using Python and R packages. The most notable being &lt;code&gt;tidycovid19&lt;/code&gt; package designed by Joachim Gassen. You can few the package on his GitHub [&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-R&#34; data-lang=&#34;R&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Importing all of the necessary packages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;tidyverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;tsibble&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;plot_covid19_spread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;confirmed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;edate_cutoff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;min_cases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/images/Measuring-Progress/first_40_days.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;First 40 Days&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

However, people have often wondered why we don&amp;rsquo;t present these numbers on a per capita basis? Burn-Murdock has provided a data-oriented reason why log-scales are used instead of per capita scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- tweet 1244380095164420101 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t always clear when per capita metrics should (or should not) be used. However, many don&amp;rsquo;t often realize how per capita figures can distort the story of what is going on in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Switzerland has 2,975 cases per capita, while the United States has 1,841 cases per capita [&lt;a href=&#34;#2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. However, cases are currently growing and doubling faster in the U.S. compared to Switzerland [3]. Obviously, Switerzland&amp;rsquo;s high per capita figure is primarily attributed to its small population size, not its response to containing the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put: per capita figures makes small countries look big, and vice versa. Not only that, per capita figures only shifts the curves vertically; it would not change the trajectory or slope of the curves. Remember the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$log(Y_{t}/P_{t})=log(Y_{t})-log(P_{t})$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $Y_{t}$ is the number of cases on dat $t$ and $P_{t}$ is the population on day $t$. Population doesn&amp;rsquo;t change much over a period of time, so per capita figures involves subtracking a constant from the log case data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same point applies to the differences in testing policies between countries. If Country A is testing more as a percentage of the population relative to Country B, then these differences will show up as a vertical difference between the plots. They won&amp;rsquo;t; however, show up in the trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these choices are still a bit of a judgment call (not standard among statisticians), we should look at the slope of the lines if we want to explore how countries are responding to the pandemic relative to others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the graph doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell us everything about how the pandemic is overwhelming the different health care systems around the world, it does show how each country is attempting to slow the infection rate and reduce the slope of their curves. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to compare the trajectory in this way, considering that we have to look to see which country is trending higher.&lt;/p&gt;
